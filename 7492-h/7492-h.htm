    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. ACQUAINTANCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The speed of the train slackened; a broad tidal river flashed into sight
      below the trestle, spreading away on either hand through yellowing level
      meadows. And now, above the roaring undertone of the cars, from far ahead
      floated back the treble bell-notes of the locomotive; there came a
      gritting vibration of brakes; slowly, more slowly the cars glided to a
      creaking standstill beside a sun-scorched platform gay with the bright
      flutter of sunshades and summer gowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shotover! Shotover!&rdquo; rang the far cry along the cars; and an
      absent-minded young man in the Pullman pocketed the uncut magazine he had
      been dreaming over and, picking up gun case and valise, followed a line of
      fellow-passengers to the open air, where one by one they were engulfed and
      lost to view amid the gay confusion on the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The absent-minded young man, however, did not seem to know exactly where
      he was bound for. He stood hesitating, leisurely inspecting the flashing
      ranks of vehicles&mdash;depot wagons, omnibusses, and motor cars already
      eddying around a dusty gravel drive centred by the conventional railroad
      flower bed and fountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunshine blazed on foliage plants arranged geometrically, on scarlet stars
      composed of geraniums, on thickets of tall flame-tinted cannas. And around
      this triumph of landscape gardening, phaeton, Tilbury, Mercedes, and
      Toledo backed, circled, tooted; gaily gowned women, whips aslant, horses
      dancing, greeted expected guests; laughing young men climbed into
      dog-carts and took the reins from nimble grooms; young girls,
      extravagantly veiled, made room in comfortable touring-cars for feminine
      guests whose extravagant veils were yet to be unpacked; slim young men in
      leather trappings, caps adorned with elaborate masks or goggles,
      manipulated rakish steering-gears; preoccupied machinists were fussing
      with valve and radiator or were cranking up; and, through the jolly
      tumult, the melancholy bell of the locomotive sounded, and the long train
      moved out through the September sunshine amid clouds of snowy steam.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all this time the young man, gun case in one hand, suit case in the
      other, looked about him in his good-humoured, leisurely manner for anybody
      or any vehicle which might be waiting for him. His amiable inspection
      presently brought a bustling baggage-master within range of vision; and he
      spoke to this official, mentioning his host's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lookin' for Mr. Ferrall?&rdquo; repeated the baggage-master, spinning a trunk
      dexterously into rank with its fellows. &ldquo;Say, one of Mr. Ferrall's men was
      here just now&mdash;there he is, over there uncrating that there
      bird-dog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man's eyes followed the direction indicated by the grimy thumb;
      a red-faced groom in familiar livery was kneeling beside a dog's
      travelling crate, attempting to unlock it, while behind the bars an
      excited white setter whined and thrust forth first one silky paw then the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man watched the scene for a moment, then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you one of Mr. Ferrall's men?&rdquo; he asked in his agreeable voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The groom looked up, then stood up:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yis, Sorr.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take these; I'm Mr. Siward&mdash;for Shotover House. I dare say you have
      room for me and the dog, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The groom opened his mouth to speak, but Siward took the crate key from
      his fingers, knelt, and tried the lock. It resisted. From the depths of
      the crate a beseeching paw fell upon his cuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, old fellow,&rdquo; he said soothingly, &ldquo;I know how you feel about
      it; I know you're in a hurry&mdash;and we'll have you out in a second&mdash;steady,
      boy!&mdash;something's jammed, you see! Only one moment now! There you
      are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog attempted to bolt as the crate door opened, but the young man
      caught him by the leather collar and the groom snapped on a leash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, Sorr,&rdquo; began the groom, carried almost off his feet by the
      frantic circling of the dog&mdash;&ldquo;beg pardon, Sorr, but I'll be afther
      seem' if anny of Mr. Ferrall's men drove over for you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Are you not one of Mr. Ferrall's men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yis, Sorr, but I hadn't anny orders to meet anny wan&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you anything here to drive me in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yis, Sorr&mdash;I'll look to see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The raw groom, much embarrassed, and keeping his feet with difficulty
      against the plunging dog, turned toward the gravel drive where now only a
      steam motor and a depot-wagon remained. As they looked the motor steamed
      out, honking hoarsely; the depot-wagon followed, leaving the circle at the
      end of the station empty of vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't Mr. Ferrall expect me?&rdquo; asked Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, yis, Sorr; but the gintlemen for Shotover House does ginerally
      allways coom by Black Fells, Sorr&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;I remember now. I should have gone on to
      Black Fells Crossing; Mr. Ferrall wrote me!&rdquo; Then, amused: &ldquo;I suppose you
      have only a baggage-wagon here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sorr&mdash;a phayton&rdquo;&mdash;he hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? Isn't a phaeton all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yis, Sorr&mdash;if th' yoong lady says so&mdash;beg pardon, Sorr, Miss
      Landis is driving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;h! I see.... Is Miss Landis a guest at Shotover House?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yis, Sorr. An' if ye would joost ask her&mdash;the phayton do be coming
      now, Sorr!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The phaeton was coming; the horse, a showy animal, executed side-steps;
      blue ribbons fluttered from the glittering head-stall; a young girl in
      white was driving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Siward advanced to the platform's edge as the phaeton drew up; the young
      lady looked inquiringly at the groom, at the dog, and leisurely at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he took off his hat, naming himself in that well-bred and agreeable
      manner characteristic of men of his sort,&mdash;and even his smile
      appeared to be part and parcel of a conventional ensemble so harmonious as
      to remain inconspicuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have gone on to Black Fells Crossing,&rdquo; observed Miss Landis,
      coolly controlling the nervous horse. &ldquo;Didn't you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said he remembered now that such were the directions given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl glanced at him incuriously, and with more curiosity at the dog.
      &ldquo;Is that the Sagamore pup, Flynn?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, Miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you take him on the rumble with you?&rdquo; And, to Siward: &ldquo;There is
      room for your gun and suit case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for me?&rdquo; he asked, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so. Be careful of that Sagamore pup, Flynn. Hold him between your
      knees. Are you ready, Mr. Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he climbed in; the groom hoisted the dog to the rumble and sprang up
      behind; the horse danced and misbehaved, making a spectacle of himself and
      an agreeable picture of his driver; then the pretty little phaeton swung
      northward out of the gravel drive and went whirling along a road all misty
      with puffs of yellow dust which the afternoon sun turned to floating
      golden powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you send my telegram, Flynn?&rdquo; she asked without turning her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, Miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It being the most important telegram she had ever sent in all her life,
      Miss Landis became preoccupied,&mdash;quite oblivious to extraneous
      details, including Siward, until the horse began acting badly again. Her
      slightly disdainful and perfect control of the reins interested the young
      man. He might have said something civil and conventional about that, but
      did not make the effort to invade a reserve which appeared to embarrass
      nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stacatto note from the dog, prolonged infinitely in hysterical
      crescendo, demanded comment from somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with him, Flynn?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Siward said: &ldquo;You should let him run, Miss Landis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, smiling, inattentive, absorbed in her own affairs, still
      theorising concerning her telegram. She drove on for a while, and might
      have forgotten the dog entirely had he not once more lifted his voice in
      melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say he ought to run for a mile or two? Do you think he'll bolt, Mr.
      Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he a new dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, fresh from the kennels; supposed to be house-and wagon-broken,
      steady to shot and wing&mdash;&rdquo; She shrugged her pretty shoulders. &ldquo;You
      see how he's acting already!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind if I try him?&rdquo; suggested Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that you are going to let him run?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he bolts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take my chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but please consider my chances, Mr. Siward. The dog doesn't belong
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he ought to run&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose he runs away? He's a horridly expensive creature&mdash;if you
      care to take the risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take the risk,&rdquo; said Siward, smiling as she drew rein. &ldquo;Now Flynn,
      give me the leash. Quiet! Quiet, puppy! Everything is coming your way;
      that's the beauty of patience; great thing, patience!&rdquo; He took the leader;
      the dog sprang from the rumble. &ldquo;Now, my friend, look at me! No, don't
      twist and squirm and scramble; look me square in the eye; so!... Now we
      know each ether and we respect each other&mdash;because you are going to
      be a good puppy... and obey... Down charge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog, trembling with eager comprehension, dropped like a shot, muzzle
      laid flat between his paws. Siward unleashed him, looked down at him for a
      second, stooped and caressed the silky head, then with a laugh swung
      himself into the phaeton beside the driver, who, pretty head turned, had
      been looking on intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your dog is yard-broken,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Look at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Do you think he will follow us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horse started, Miss Landis looking back over her shoulder at the dog
      who lay motionless, crouched flat in the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Siward turned. &ldquo;Come on, Sagamore!&rdquo; he said gaily; and the dog sprang
      forward, circled about the moving phaeton, splitting the air with yelps of
      ecstasy, then tore ahead, mad with the delight of stretching cramped
      muscles amid the long rank grass and shrubbery of the roadside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl watched him doubtfully; when he disappeared far away up the road
      she turned the blue inquiry of her eyes on Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll be back,&rdquo; said the young fellow, laughing; and presently the dog
      reappeared on a tearing gallop, white flag tossing, glorious in his new
      liberty, enchanted with the confidence this tall young man had reposed in
      him&mdash;this adorable young man, this wonderful friend who had suddenly
      appeared to release him from an undignified and abominable situation in a
      crate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good dog,&rdquo; said Siward; and the girl looked around at him, partly
      because his voice was pleasant, partly because a vague memory was
      beginning to stir within her, coupling something unpleasant with the name
      of Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been conscious of it when he first named himself, but, absorbed in
      the overwhelming importance of her telegram, had left the analysis of the
      matter for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought again of her telegram, theorised a little, came to no
      conclusion except to let the matter rest for the present, and mentally
      turned to the next and far less important problem&mdash;the question of
      this rather attractive young man at her side, and why the name of Siward
      should be linked in her mind with anything disagreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tentatively following the elusive mental dews that might awaken something
      definite concerning her hazy impression of the man beside her, she spoke
      pleasantly, conventionally, touching idly any topic that might have a
      bearing; and, under a self-possession so detached as to give an impression
      of indifference, eyes, ears, and intelligence admitted that he was
      agreeable to look at, pleasant of voice, and difficult to reconcile with
      anything unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which gradually aroused her interest&mdash;the incongruous usually
      interesting girls of her age&mdash;for he had wit enough to amuse her,
      sufficient inconsequence to please her, and something listless, at times
      almost absent-minded, almost inattentive, that might have piqued her had
      it not inoculated her, as it always does any woman, with the nascent germ
      of curiosity. Besides, there was, in the hint of his momentary
      preoccupation, a certain charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      They discussed shooting and the opening of the season; dogs and the
      training of dogs; and why some go gun-shy and why some ace blinkers. From
      sport and its justification, they became inconsequential; and she was
      beginning to enjoy the freshness of their chance acquaintance, his nice
      attitude toward things, his irrelevancy, his gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laughter thawed her; for notwithstanding the fearless confidence she had
      been taught for men of her own kind, self-possession and reserve, if not
      inherent, had also been drilled into her, and she required a great deal in
      a man before she paid him the tribute of one of her pretty laughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently they were advancing rather rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think we ought to call the dog in, Mr. Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he's had enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew rein; he sprang out and whistled; and the Sagamore pup, dusty and
      happy came romping back. Siward motioned him to the rumble, but the dog
      leaped to the front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mind,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Let him sit here between us. And you might
      occupy yourself by pulling some of those burrs from his ears&mdash;if you
      will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will. Look up here, puppy! No! Don't try to lick my face, for
      that is bad manners. Demonstrations are odious, as the poet says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's always bad manners, isn't it?&rdquo; asked Miss Landis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Being affectionate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and admitting it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it is. Do you hear that&mdash;Sagamore? But never mind; I'll
      break the rules some day when we're alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog laid one paw on Siward's knee, looking him wistfully in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More demonstrations,&rdquo; observed the girl. &ldquo;Mr. Siward! You are hugging
      him! This amounts to a dual conspiracy in bad manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awfully glad to admit you to the conspiracy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There's one
      vacancy&mdash;if you are eligible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am; I was discovered recently kissing my saddle-mare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That settles it! Sagamore, give the young lady the grip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia Landis glanced at the dog, then impulsively shifting the whip to
      her left hand, held out the right. And very gravely the Sagamore pup laid
      one paw in her dainty white gloved palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You darling!&rdquo; murmured the girl, resuming her whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I notice,&rdquo; observed Siward, &ldquo;that you are perfectly qualified for
      membership in our association for the promotion of bad manners. In fact I
      should suggest you for the presidency&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you think all sorts of things because I gushed over that dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well you need not,&rdquo; she rejoined, delicate nose up-tilted. &ldquo;I never
      kissed a baby in all my life&mdash;and never mean to. Which is probably
      more than you can say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, its more than I can say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That admission elects you president,&rdquo; she concluded. But after a moment's
      silent driving she turned partly toward him with mock seriousness: &ldquo;Is it
      not horridly unnatural in me to feel that way about babies? And about
      people, too; I simply cannot endure demonstrations. As for dogs and horses&mdash;well,
      I've admitted how I behave; and, being so shamelessly affectionate by
      disposition, why can't I be nice to babies? I've a hazy but dreadful
      notion that there's something wrong about me, Mr. Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He scrutinised the pretty features, anxiously; &ldquo;I can't see it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I mean it&mdash;almost seriously. I don't want to be so aloof, but&mdash;I
      don't like to touch other people. It is rather horrid of me I suppose to
      be like those silky, plumy, luxurious Angora cats who never are civil to
      you and who always jump out of your arms at the first opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed&mdash;and there was malice in his eyes, but he did not know her
      well enough to pursue the subject through so easy an opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had occurred to her, too, that her simile might invite elaboration, and
      she sensed the laugh in his silence, and liked him for remaining silent
      where he might easily have been wittily otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      This set her so much at ease, left her so confident, that they were on
      terms of gayest understanding presently, she gossiping about the guests at
      Shotover House, outlining the diversions planned for the two weeks before
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we shall see little of one another; you will be shooting most of the
      time,&rdquo; she said&mdash;with the very faintest hint of challenge&mdash;too
      delicate, too impersonal to savour of coquetry. But the germ of it was
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you shoot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am reconciled to the shooting, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is awfully civil of you. Sometimes I'd rather play Bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So should I&mdash;sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll remember that, Mr. Siward; and when all the men are waiting for you
      to start out after grouse perhaps I may take that moment to whisper: 'May
      I play?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that you really would stay and play double dummy when every
      other living man will be off to the coverts? Double dummy&mdash;to improve
      my game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly! I need improvement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is something wrong with you, too, Mr. Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and started to flick her whip, but at her first motion the
      horse gave trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bit doesn't fit,&rdquo; observed Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are perfectly right,&rdquo; she returned, surprised. &ldquo;I ought to have
      remembered; it is shameful to drive a horse improperly bitted.&rdquo; And, after
      a moment: &ldquo;You are considerate toward animals; it is good in a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's no merit. When animals are uncomfortable it worries me. It's one
      sort of selfishness, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense,&rdquo; she said; and her smile was very friendly. &ldquo;Why doesn't a
      nice man ever admit he's nice when told so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seems they had advanced that far. For she was beginning to find this
      young man not only safe but promising; she had met nobody recently half as
      amusing, and the outlook at Shotover House had been unpromising with only
      the overgrateful Page twins to practise on&mdash;the other men
      collectively and individually boring her. And suddenly, welcome as manna
      from the sky, behold this highly agreeable boy to play with&mdash;until
      Quarrier arrived. Her telegram had been addressed to Mr. Quarrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it you were saying about selfishness?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Oh, I
      remember. It was nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, adding: &ldquo;Selfishness is so simply defined you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it? How.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A refusal to renounce. That covers everything,&rdquo; she concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes renunciation is weakness&mdash;isn't it?&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what case for example?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, suppose we take love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, you may take it if you like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you loved a man!&rdquo; he insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him beware! What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;And, suppose it would distress your family if you married him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd give him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you loved him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love? That is the poorest excuse for selfishness, Mr. Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you would ruin your happiness and his&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A girl ought to find more happiness in renouncing a selfish love than in
      love itself,&rdquo; announced Miss Landis with that serious conviction
      characteristic of her years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; assented Siward with a touch of malice, &ldquo;if you really do
      find more happiness in renouncing love than in love itself, it would be
      foolish not to do it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Siward! You are derisive. Besides, you are not acute. A woman is
      always an opportunist. When the event takes place I shall know what to
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean when you want to marry the man you mustn't?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. I probably shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. But you won't, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew rein, bringing the horse to a walk at the foot of a long hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going much too fast,&rdquo; said Miss Landis, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Driving too fast for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not driving, going&mdash;you and I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes I do. We are on all sorts of terms, already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the country, you know, people&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes I know all about it, and what old and valued friends one makes at a
      week's end. But it has been a matter of half-hours with us, Mr. Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us sit very still and think it over,&rdquo; he suggested. And they both
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps the reaction of her gaiety that recalled to her mind her
      telegram. The telegram had been her promised answer after she had had time
      to consider a suggestion made to her by a Mr. Howard Quarrier. The last
      week at Shotover permitted reflection; and while her telegram was no
      complete answer to the suggestion he had made, it contained material of
      interest in the eight words: &ldquo;I will consider your request when you
      arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if you know Howard Quarrier?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a second's hesitation he replied: &ldquo;Yes&mdash;a little. Everybody
      does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only at&mdash;the club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the Lenox?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lenox&mdash;and the Patroons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Preoccupied, driving with careless, almost inattentive perfection, she
      thought idly of her twenty-three years, wondering how life could have
      passed so quickly leaving her already stranded on the shoals of an
      engagement to marry Howard Quarrier. Then her thoughts, errant, wandered
      half the world over before they returned to Siward; and when at length
      they did, and meaning to be civil, she spoke again of his acquaintance
      with Quarrier at the Patroons Club&mdash;the club itself being sufficient
      to settle Siward's status in every community.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm trying to remember what it is I have heard about you,&rdquo; she continued
      amiably; &ldquo;you are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An odd expression in his eyes arrested her&mdash;long enough to note their
      colour and expression&mdash;and she continued, pleasantly; &ldquo;&mdash;you are
      Stephen Siward, are you not? You see I know your name perfectly well&mdash;&rdquo;
       Her straight brows contracted a trifle; she drove on, lips compressed,
      following an elusive train of thought which vaguely, persistently, coupled
      his name with something indefinitely unpleasant. And she could not
      reconcile this with his appearance. However, the train of unlinked ideas
      which she pursued began to form the semblance of a chain. Coupling his
      name with Quarrier's, and with a club, aroused memory; vague uneasiness
      stirred her to a glimmering comprehension. Siward? Stephen Siward? One of
      the New York Siwards then;&mdash;one of that race&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the truth flashed upon her,&mdash;the crude truth lacking
      definite detail, lacking circumstance and colour and atmosphere,&mdash;merely
      the raw and ugly truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he looked at her&mdash;and he did, once&mdash;he could have seen only
      the unruffled and very sweet profile of a young girl. Composure was one of
      the masks she had learned to wear&mdash;when she chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she was thinking very hard all the while; &ldquo;So this is the man? I might
      have known his name. Where were my five wits? Siward!&mdash;Stephen
      Siward!... He is very young, too... much too young to be so horrid.... Yet&mdash;it
      wasn't so dreadful, after all; only the publicity! Dear me! I knew we were
      going too fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Landis,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Siward?&rdquo;&mdash;very gently. It was her way to be gentle when
      generous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you are beginning to remember where you may have
      heard my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;a little&mdash;&rdquo; She looked at him with the direct gaze of a
      child, but the lovely eyes were troubled. His smile was not very genuine,
      but he met her gaze steadily enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was rather nice of Mrs. Ferrall to ask me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;after the mess I
      made of things last spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace Ferrall is a dear,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment he ventured: &ldquo;I suppose you saw it in the papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so; I had completely forgotten it; your name seemed to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Then, listlessly: &ldquo;I couldn't have ventured to remind you that&mdash;that
      perhaps you might not care to be so amiable&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Siward,&rdquo; she said impulsively, &ldquo;you are nice to me! Why shouldn't I
      be amiable? It was&mdash;it was&mdash;I've forgotten just how dreadfully
      you did behave&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is your opinion Mr. Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I ought to have known better.&rdquo; Something about him reminded her of a
      bad small boy; and suddenly in spite of her better sense, in spite of her
      instinctive caution, she found herself on the very verge of laughter. What
      was it in the man that disarmed and invited a confidence&mdash;scarcely
      justified it appeared? What was it now that moved her to overlook what few
      overlook&mdash;not the fault, but its publicity? Was it his agreeable
      bearing, his pleasant badinage, his amiably listless moments of
      preoccupation, his youth that appealed to her&mdash;aroused her charity,
      her generosity, her curiosity?
    </p>
    <p>
      And had other people continued to accept him, too? What would Quarrier
      think of his presence at Shotover? She began to realise that she was a
      little afraid of Quarrier's opinions. And his opinions were always
      judgments. However Grace Ferrall had thought it proper to ask him, and
      that meant social absolution. As far as that went she also was perfectly
      ready to absolve him if he needed it. But perhaps he didn't care!&mdash;She
      looked at him, furtively. He seemed to be tranquil enough in his
      abstraction. Trouble appeared to slide very easily from his broad young
      shoulders. Perhaps he was already taking much for granted in her
      gentleness with him. And gradually speculation became interest and
      interest a young girl's innocent curiosity to learn something of a man
      whose record it seemed almost impossible to reconcile with his
      personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wondering,&rdquo; he said looking up to encounter her clear eyes, &ldquo;whose
      house that is over there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beverly Plank's shooting-box; Black Fells,&rdquo; she replied nodding toward
      the vast pile of blackish rocks against the sky, upon which sprawled a
      heavy stone house infested with chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plank? Oh yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled to remember the battering blows rained upon the ramparts of
      society by the master of Black Fells.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the smile faded; and, glancing at him, the girl was surprised to see
      the subtle change in his face&mdash;the white worn look, then the old
      listless apathy which, all at once to her, hinted of something graver than
      preoccupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we near the sea?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very near. Only a moment to the top of this hill.... Now look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There lay the sea&mdash;the same grey-blue crawling void that had ever
      fascinated and repelled him&mdash;always wrinkled, always in flat
      monotonous motion, spreading away, away to the sad world's ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Full of menace&mdash;always,&rdquo; he said, unconscious that he had spoken
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke without turning: &ldquo;The sea is a relentless thing for a man to
      fight.... There are other tides more persistent than the sea, but like it&mdash;like
      it in its menace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face seemed thinner, older; she noticed his cheek bones for the first
      time. Then, meeting her eyes, youth returned with a laugh and a touch of
      colour; and, without understanding exactly how, she was aware, presently,
      that they had insensibly slipped back to their light badinage and gay
      inconsequences&mdash;back to a footing which, strangely, seemed to be
      already an old footing, familiar, pleasant, and natural to return to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that Shotover House?&rdquo; he asked as they came to the crest of the last
      hillock between them and the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, Mr. Siward,&rdquo; she said mockingly; &ldquo;and now your troubles are
      nearly ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yours, Miss Landis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; she murmured to herself, thinking of the telegram with the
      faintest misgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      For she was very young, and she had not had half enough out of life as
      yet; and besides, her theories and preconceived plans for the safe and
      sound ordering of her life appeared to lack weight&mdash;nay, they were
      dwindling already into insignificance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theory had almost decided her to answer Mr. Quarrier's suggestion with a
      'Yes.' However, he was coming from the Lakes in a day or two. She could
      decide definitely when she had discussed the matter with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish that I owned this dog,&rdquo; observed Siward, as the phaeton entered
      the macadamised drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish so, too,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but he belongs to Mr. Quarrier.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II IMPRUDENCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      A house of native stone built into and among weather-scarred rocks, one
      massive wing butting seaward, others nosing north and south among cedars
      and outcropping ledges&mdash;the whole silver-grey mass of masonry
      reddening under a westering sun, every dormer, every leaded diamond pane
      aflame; this was Shotover as Siward first beheld it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the craggy vertebrae of a half-buried fossil splitting the sod, a
      ragged line of rock rose as a barrier to inland winds; the foreland, set
      here and there with tiny lawns and pockets of bright flowers, fell away to
      the cliffs; and here, sheer wet black rocks fronted the eternal battering
      of the Atlantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the phaeton drew up under a pillared porte-cochere, one or two servants
      appeared; a rather imposing specimen bowed them through the doors into the
      hall where, in a wide chimney place, the embers of a drift-wood fire
      glimmered like a heap of dusty jewels. Bars of sunlight slanted on wall
      and rug, on stone floor and carved staircase, on the bronze foliations of
      the railed gallery above, where, in the golden gloom through a high
      window, sun-tipped tree tops against a sky of azure stirred like burnished
      foliage in a tapestry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nobody here, of course,&rdquo; observed Miss Landis to Siward as they
      halted in front of the fire-place; &ldquo;the season opens to-day in this
      county, you see.&rdquo; She shrugged her pretty shoulders: &ldquo;And the women who
      don't shoot make the first field-luncheon a function.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned, nodded her adieux, then, over her shoulder, casually: &ldquo;If you
      haven't an appointment with the Sand-Man before dinner you may find me in
      the gun-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be there in about three minutes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and what about this
      dog?&rdquo;&mdash;looking down at the Sagamore pup who stood before him,
      wagging, attentive, always the gentleman to the tips of his toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Landis laughed. &ldquo;Take him to your room if you like. Dogs have the run
      of the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he followed a servant to the floor above where a smiling and very
      ornamental maid preceded him through a corridor and into that heavy wing
      of the house which fronted the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tea is served in the gun-room, sir,&rdquo; said the pretty maid, and
      disappeared to give place to a melancholy and silent young man who turned
      on the bath, laid out fresh raiment, and whispering, &ldquo;Scotch or Irish,
      sir?&rdquo; presently effaced himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he quenched his own thirst Siward filled a bowl and set it on the
      floor, and it seemed as though the dog would never finish gulping and
      slobbering in the limpid icy water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the salt air, my boy,&rdquo; commented the young man, gravely refilling
      his own glass as though accepting the excuse on his own account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then man and beast completed ablutions and grooming and filed out through
      the wide corridor, around the gallery, and down the broad stairway to the
      gun-room&mdash;an oaken vaulted place illuminated by the sun, where mellow
      lights sparkled on glass-cased rows of fowling pieces and rifles, on the
      polished antlers of shaggy moose heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Landis sat curled up in a cushioned corner under the open casement
      panes, offering herself a cup of tea. She looked up, nodding invitation;
      he found a place beside her. A servant whispered, &ldquo;Scotch or Irish, sir,&rdquo;
       then set the crystal paraphernalia at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said something about the salt air, casually; the girl gazed
      meditatively at space.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of wheels on the gravel outside aroused her from a silence which
      had become a brown study; and, to Siward, presently, she said: &ldquo;Here
      endeth our first rendezvous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us arrange another immediately,&rdquo; he said, stirring the ice in
      his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl considered him with speculative eyes: &ldquo;I shouldn't exactly know
      what to do with you for the next hour if I didn't abandon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why bother to do anything with me? Why even give yourself the trouble of
      deserting me? That solves the problem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don't mean that you are a problem to me, Mr. Siward,&rdquo; she said,
      amused; &ldquo;I mean that I am going to drive again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No you don't see at all. There's a telegram; I'm not driving for pleasure&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had not meant that either, and it annoyed her that she had expressed
      herself in such terms. As a matter of fact, at the telegraphed request of
      Mr. Quarrier, she was going to Black Fells Crossing to meet his train from
      the Lakes and drive him back to Shotover. The drive, therefore, was of
      course a drive for pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; repeated Siward amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you do,&rdquo; she observed, rising to her graceful height. He was on
      his feet at once, so carelessly, so good-humouredly acquiescent that
      without any reason at all she hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had meant to show you about&mdash;the cliffs&mdash;the kennels and
      stables; I'm sorry,&rdquo; she concluded, lingering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm awfully sorry,&rdquo; he rejoined without meaning anything in particular.
      That was the trouble, whatever he said, apparently meant so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the agreeable sensation of being regretted, she leisurely gloved
      herself, then walked through the gun-room and hall, Siward strolling
      beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog followed them as they turned toward the door and passed out across
      the terraced veranda to the driveway where a Tandem cart was drawn up,
      faultlessly appointed. Quarrier's mania was Tandem. She thought it rather
      nice of her to remember this.
    </p>
    <p>
      She inspected the ensemble without visible interest for a few moments; the
      wind freshened from the sea, fluttering her veil, and she turned toward
      the east to face it. In the golden splendour of declining day the white
      sails of yachts crowded landward on the last leg before beating westward
      into Blue Harbour; a small white cruiser, steaming south, left a mile long
      stratum of rose-tinted smoke hanging parallel to the horizon's plane; the
      westering sun struck sparks from her bright-work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magic light on land and water seemed to fascinate the girl; she had
      walked a little way toward the cliffs, Siward following silently, offering
      no comment on the beauty of sky and cliff. As they halted once more the
      enchantment seemed to spread; a delicate haze enveloped the sea; hints of
      rose colour tinted the waves; over the uplands a pale mauve bloom grew;
      the sunlight turned redder, slanting on the rocks, and every kelp-covered
      reef became a spongy golden mound, sprayed with liquid flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had turned their backs to the Tandem; the grooms looked after them,
      standing motionless at the horses' heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Siward, this is too fine to miss,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will walk as far as
      the headland with you.... Please smoke if you care to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did care to; several matches were extinguished by the wind until she
      spread her skids as a barrier; and kneeling in their shelter he got his
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tobacco smoke diluted with sea breeze is delicious,&rdquo; she said, as the
      wind whirled the aromatic smoke of his cigarette up into her face. &ldquo;Don't
      move, Mr. Siward; I like it; there is to me always a faint odour of
      sweet-brier in the mÃ©lange. Did you ever notice it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The breeze-blown conversation became fragmentary, veering as capriciously
      as the purple wind-flaws that spread across the shoals. But always to her
      question or comment she found in his response the charm of freshness, of
      quick intelligence, or of a humourous and idle perversity which stimulates
      without demanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, glancing back at the house where the T-cart and horses stood, she
      said that she had better return; or perhaps she only thought she said it,
      for he made no response that time. And a few moments later they reached
      the headland, and the Atlantic lay below, flowing azure from horizon to
      horizon&mdash;under a universe of depthless blue. And for a long while
      neither spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      With her the spell endured until conscience began to stir. Then she awoke,
      uneasy as always, under the shadow of restraint or pressure, until her
      eyes fell on him and lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A subtle change had come into his face; its leanness struck her for the
      first time; that, and an utter detachment from his surroundings, a sombre
      oblivion to everything&mdash;and to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      How curiously had his face altered, how shadowy it had grown, effacing the
      charm of youth, in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slight amusement with which she had become conscious of her own
      personal exclusion grew to an interest tinged with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interest continued, but when his silence became irksome to her she
      said so very frankly. His absent eyes, still clouded, met hers, unsmiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate the sea,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;hate it!&rdquo; she repeated, too incredulous to be disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no rest in it; it tires. A man who plays with it must be on his
      guard every second. To spend a lifetime on it is ridiculous&mdash;a whole
      life of intelligent effort, against perpetual, brutal, inanimate
      resistance&mdash;one endless uninterrupted fight&mdash;a ceaseless human
      manoeuvre against senseless menace; and then the counter attack of the
      lifeless monster, the bellowing advance, the shock&mdash;and no battle won&mdash;nothing
      final, nothing settled, no! only the same eternal nightmare of
      surveillance, the same sleepless watch for stupid treachery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;you don't have to fight it!&rdquo; she said, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but it is no secret&mdash;what it does to those who do.... Some
      escape; but only by dying ashore before it gets them. That is the way some
      of us reach Heaven; we die too quick for the Enemy to catch us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was laughing when she said: &ldquo;It is not a fight with the sea; it is the
      battle of Life itself you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in a way, the battle of Life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are morbid then. Is there anybody ever born who has not a fight
      on his hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; only I have known men tired out, unfairly, before life had declared
      war on them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, something about fair play&mdash;what our popular idol summarises as a
      'square deal'.&rdquo; He laughed again, easily, his face clearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody worth a square deal ever laments because he hasn't had it,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say that's true, too,&rdquo; he admitted listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Siward, exactly what did you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of men I knew; for example a man who through generations
      has inherited every impulse and desire that he should not harbour&mdash;a
      man with intellect enough to be aware of it, with decency enough to desire
      decency.... What chance has he with the storms which have been brewing for
      him even before he opened his eyes on earth? Is that a square deal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The troubled concentration of her face was reflected now in his own; the
      wind came whipping and flicking at them from league-wide tossing wastes;
      the steady thunder of the sea accented the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: &ldquo;I suppose everybody has infinite capacity for decency or
      mischief. I know that I have. And I fancy that this capacity always
      remains, no matter how moral one's life may be. 'Watch and pray' was not
      addressed to the guilty alone, Mr. Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, of course. As for the balanced capacity for good and evil, how
      about the inherited desire for the latter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is free from that, too? Do you suppose anybody really desires to be
      good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean most people are so afraid not to be, that virtue becomes a
      habit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. It's a plain business proposition anyway. It pays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Celestial insurance?&rdquo; he asked, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, Mr. Siward; do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he, turning to the sea, had become engrossed in his own thoughts
      again; and again she was first curious, then impatient at the ease with
      which he excluded her. She remembered, too, that the cart was waiting;
      that she had scarcely time now to make the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood irresolute, inert, disinclined to bestir herself. An inborn
      aptitude for drifting, which threatened to become a talent for indecision,
      had always alternated in her with sudden impulsive conclusions; and when
      her pride was involved, in decisions which sometimes scarcely withstood
      the analysis of reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Physically healthy, mentally unawakened, sentimentally incredulous,
      totally ignorant of any master passion, and conventionally drilled, her
      beauty and sweet temper had carried her easily on the frothy crest of her
      first season, over the eligible and ineligible alike, leaving her at
      Lenox, a rather tired and breathless girl, in love with pleasure and the
      world which treated her so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death of her mother abroad had made little impression upon her&mdash;her
      uncle, Major Belwether, having cared for her since her father's death when
      she was ten years old. So, although the scandal of her mother's self-exile
      had been in a measure condoned by a tardy marriage to the man for whom she
      had left everything, her daughter had grown up ignorant of any particular
      feeling for a mother she could scarcely remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, she wore black and went nowhere for the second winter, during
      which time she learned a great deal concerning the unconventional
      proclivities of the women of her race and family, enough to impress her so
      seriously that on an exaggerated impulse she had come to one of her
      characteristic decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      That decision was to break the unsavoury record at the first justifiable
      opportunity. And the opportunity came in the shape of Quarrier. As though
      wedlock were actually the sanctuary which an alarmed nation pretends it to
      be!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, approaching the threshold of a third and last season, and having put
      away her almost meaningless mourning, there had stolen into her sense of
      security something irksome in the promise she had made to give Quarrier a
      definite answer before winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it had been the lack of interest in the people at Shotover,
      perhaps a mental review of her ancestors' capricious records&mdash;perhaps
      a characteristic impulse that had directed a telegram to Quarrier after a
      midnight confab with Grace Ferrall.
    </p>
    <p>
      However it may have been, she had summoned him. And now he was on his way
      to get his answer, the best whip, the most eagerly discussed, and one of
      the wealthiest unmarried men in America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lingering irresolutely, considering with idle eyes the shadows lengthening
      across the sun-shot moorland, the sound of Siward's even voice aroused her
      from a meditation bordering on lassitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered vaguely. He spoke again; all the agreeable, gentle, humourous
      charm dominant once more&mdash;releasing her from the growing tension of
      her own thoughts, absolving her from the duty of immediate decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel curiously lazy,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;perhaps from our long drive.&rdquo; She
      seated herself on the turf. &ldquo;Talk to me, Mr. Siward&mdash;in that lazy way
      of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What he had to say proved inconsequent enough, an irrelevant suggestion
      concerning the training of field-dogs for close covert work and the
      reasons for not breaking such dogs on quail. Then the question of
      cross-breeding came up, and he gave his opinion on the qualities of
      &ldquo;droppers.&rdquo; To which she replied, sleepily; and the conversation veered
      again toward the mystery of heredity, and the hopelessness of escape from
      its laws as illustrated now by the Sagamore pup, galloping nose in the
      wind, having scented afar the traces of the forbidden rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His ancestors turned 'round and 'round to flatten the long reeds and
      grasses in their lairs before lying down,&rdquo; observed Siward. &ldquo;He does it,
      too, where there is nothing to flatten out. Did you ever notice how many
      times a dog turns around before lying down? And there goes the carefully
      schooled Sagamore, chasing rabbits! Why? Because his wild ancestors chased
      rabbits.... Heredity? It's a steady, unseen, pulling, dragging force. Like
      lightning, too, it shatters, sometimes, where there is resistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean, Mr. Siward, that heredity is an excuse for moral weakness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Those inheriting nothing of evil say it is no excuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no excuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak with authority,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With more than you are aware of,&rdquo; she murmured, not meaning to say it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood up impulsively, her fresh face turned to the distant house, her
      rounded young figure poised in relief against the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inherited or not, idleness, procrastination, are my besetting sins. Can't
      you suggest the remedy, Mr. Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are only the thieves of Time; and we kill the poor old
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leagued assassins,&rdquo; she repeated pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her gown had caught on the cliff briers; he knelt to release it, she
      looking down, noting an ugly tear in the fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Payment for my iniquities&mdash;the first instalment,&rdquo; she said, still
      looking down over his shoulder and watching his efforts to release her.
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Siward. I think we ought to start, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He straightened up, smiling, awaiting her further pleasure. Her pleasure
      being capricious, she seated herself again, saying: &ldquo;What I meant to say
      was this: evils that spring from heredity are no excuse for misconduct in
      people of our sort. Environment, not heredity, counts. And it's our
      business, who have every chance in the world, to make good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked down, amused at the piquant incongruity of voice and vernacular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; she asked irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at his watch. She turned her eyes toward the level sun,
      conscious, and a little conscience-stricken that it was too late for her
      to drive to Black Fells Crossing&mdash;unless she started at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun hung low over the pines; all the scrubby foreland ran molten gold
      in every tufted furrow; flock after flock of twittering little birds
      whirled into the briers and out again, scattering inland into undulating
      flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The zenith turned shell pink; through clotted shoals of clouds spread
      spaces of palest green like calm lakes in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew stiller; the wind went down with the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless he had forgotten to tell her the time; she had almost forgotten
      that she had asked him. With the silence of sunset a languor, the
      indolence of content, crept over her; she saw him close his watch with the
      absent-minded air which she already associated with him, and she let the
      question go from sheer disinclination for the effort of repetition&mdash;let
      the projected drive go&mdash;acquiescent, content that matters shape
      themselves without any interference from her. The sense of ease, of
      physical well-being invaded her with an agreeable relaxation as though
      tension somewhere had slackened.
    </p>
    <p>
      They chatted on, casually, impersonally, in rather subdued tones. The dog
      returned now and then to see that all was well. All was well enough, it
      appeared, for she sat beside Siward, quite content, knees clasped in her
      hands, exchanging impressions of life with a man who so far had been
      sympathetically considerate in demanding from her no intellectual effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation drifted illogically; sometimes he stirred her to
      amusement, even a hushed laughter; sometimes she smilingly agreed with his
      views, sometimes she let them go, uncriticised; or, intent on her own
      ideas, shook her small head in amused disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stillness over all, the deepening mellow light, the blessed indolence
      of the young world&mdash;and their few years in it&mdash;Youth! That was
      perhaps the key to it all, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; she mused aloud, knees cradled in her clasped fingers,
      &ldquo;to-morrow they'll shoot&mdash;with great circumstance and fuss&mdash;a
      few native woodcock&mdash;there's no flight yet from the north!&mdash;a
      few grouse, fewer snipe, a stray duck or two. Others will drive motor cars
      over bad roads; others will ride, sail, golf&mdash;anything to kill the
      eternal enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Je n'en sais rien, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mais je voudrais savoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pourquoi?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To lay a true course by the stars&rdquo;; he looked at her blue eyes and she
      laughed easily under the laughing flattery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must seek another compass&mdash;to-morrow,&rdquo; she said. Then it
      occurred to her that nobody could guess her decision in regard to
      Quarrier; and she partly raised her eyes, looking at him, indolent
      speculation under the white lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      She liked him already; in fact she had liked few men as well on such brief
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the majority of the people here, or coming, don't you?&rdquo; she
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began: &ldquo;The Leroy Mortimers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Alderdene and Captain Voucher, and the Page twins and Marion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rena Bonnesdel, the Tassel girl, Agatha Caithness, Mrs. Vendenning&mdash;all
      sorts, all sets.&rdquo; And, with an effort: &ldquo;If I'm to drive, I should like&mdash;to&mdash;to
      know what time it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He informed her; and she, too indolent to pretend surprise, and finding
      reproach easier, told him that he had no business to permit her to forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      His smiling serenity under the rebuke aroused in her a slight resentment
      as though he had taken something for granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, she had grown uneasy; she had wired Quarrier, saying she would
      meet him and drive him over. He had replied at once, naming his train. He
      was an exact man and expected method and precision in others. She didn't
      exactly know how it might affect him if his reasonable demand was
      unsatisfied. She did not know him very well yet, only well enough to be
      aware that he was a gentleman so precisely, so judiciously constructed,
      that, contemplating his equitable perfections, her awe and admiration grew
      as one on whom dawns the exquisite adjustments of an almost human machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, thinking of him now, she again made up her mind to give him the
      answer which he now had every reason to expect from her. This decision
      appeared to lubricate her conscience; it ran more smoothly now, emitting
      fewer creaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that you know Mr. Quarrier?&rdquo; she began thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;hope you will like him, Mr. Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think he likes me, Miss Landis. He has reasons not to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up, suddenly remembering: &ldquo;Oh&mdash;since that scrape? What has
      Mr. Quarrier to do&mdash;&rdquo; She did not finish the sentence. A troubled
      silence followed; she was trying to remember the details&mdash;something
      she had paid small attention to at the time&mdash;something so foreign to
      her, so distant from her comprehension that it had not touched her closely
      enough for her to remember exactly what this young man might have done to
      forfeit the good-will of Howard Quarrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at Siward; it was impossible that anything very bad could come
      from such a man. And, pursuing her reasoning aloud: &ldquo;It couldn't have been
      very awful,&rdquo; she argued; &ldquo;something foolish about an actress, was it not?
      And that could not concern Mr. Quarrier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you did know; I thought you&mdash;remembered&mdash;while you
      were driving me over from the station&mdash;that I was dropped from my
      club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flushed up: &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;but&mdash;what had Mr. Quarrier to do with
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a governor of that club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that Mr. Quarrier had you&mdash;dropped?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else could he do? A man who is idiot enough to risk making his own
      club notorious, must take the consequences. And they say I took that risk.
      Therefore Mr. Quarrier, Major Belwether&mdash;all the governors did their
      duty. I&mdash;I naturally conclude that no governor of the Patroons Club
      feels very kindly toward me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Landis sat very still, her small head bent, a flush still brightening
      her fair face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recalled a few of the details now&mdash;the scandal&mdash;something of
      the story. Which particular actress it was she could not remember; but
      some men who had dined too freely had made the wager, and this boy sitting
      beside her had accepted it&mdash;and won it, by bringing into the sacred
      precincts of the Patroons Club a foolish, shameless girl disguised in a
      man's evening dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was bad enough; that somebody promptly discovered it was worse; but
      worst of all was the publicity, the club's name smirched, the young man
      expelled from one of the two best clubs in the metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      To read of such things in the columns of a daily paper had meant little to
      her except to repell her; to hear it mentioned among people of her own
      sort had left her incurious and indifferent. But now she saw it in a new
      light, with the man who had figured in it seated beside her. Did such men
      as he&mdash;such attractive, well-bred, amusing men as he&mdash;do that
      sort of thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      There he sat, hat off, the sun touching his short, thick hair which waved
      a little at the temples&mdash;a boyish mould to head and shoulders, a
      cleanly outlined check and chin, a thoroughbred ear set close&mdash;a good
      face. What sort of a man, then, was a woman to feel at ease with? What
      eye, what mouth, what manner, what bearing was a woman to trust?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the kind of man you are, Mr. Siward?&rdquo; she said impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears that I was; I don't know what I am&mdash;or may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pity of it!&rdquo; she said, still swayed by impulse. &ldquo;Why did you do&mdash;didn't
      you know&mdash;realize what you were doing&mdash;bringing discredit on
      your own club?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in no condition to know, Miss Landis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crude brutality of the expression might merely have hurt or disgusted
      her had she been less intelligent. Nor, as it was, did she fully
      understand why he chose to use it&mdash;unless that he meant it in
      self-punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's rather shameful!&rdquo; she said hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he assented; &ldquo;it's a bad beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;beginning! Do you mean to go on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply; his head was partly turned from her. She sat silent for
      a while. The dog had returned to lie at Siward's feet, its brown eyes
      tirelessly watching the man it had chosen for its friend; and the man,
      without turning his eyes, dropped one hand on the dog's head, caressing
      the silky ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some sentimentalist had once said that no man who cared for animals could
      be wholly bad. Inexperience inclined her to believe it. Then too, she had
      that inclination for overlooking offences committed against precept, which
      appears to be one of those edifying human traits peculiar to neither sex
      and common to both. Besides, her knowledge of such matters was as vague as
      her mind was healthy and body wholesome. Men who dined incautiously were
      not remarkable for their rarity; the actress habit, being incomprehensible
      to her, meant nothing; and she said, innocently: &ldquo;What men like you can
      find attractive in a common woman I do not understand; there are plenty of
      pretty women of your own sort. The actress cult is beyond my
      comprehension; I only know it is generally condoned. But it is not for
      such things that we drop men, Mr. Siward. You know that, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what do you drop men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For falsehood, deception, any dishonesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don't drop a man when you read in the papers that one of the two
      best clubs in town has expelled him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a troubled glance; and, naively: &ldquo;But you are still a member
      of the other, are you not?&rdquo; Then hardening: &ldquo;It was common! common!&mdash;thoroughly
      disgraceful and incomprehensible!&rdquo;&mdash;and with every word uttered
      insensibly warming in her heart toward him whom she was chastening; &ldquo;it
      was not even bad&mdash;it was worse than being simply bad; it was stupid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, one hand slowly caressing the dog's head where it lay across
      his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched him a moment, hesitated, then smiling a little: &ldquo;So now I know
      the worst about you; do I not?&rdquo; she concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer; she waited, the smile still curving her red mouth. Had
      she been too severe? She wondered. &ldquo;You may help me to my feet,&rdquo; she said
      sweetly. She was very young.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose at once, holding out his hands to aid her in that pleasantly
      impersonal manner so suited to him; and now they stood together in the
      purple dusk of the uplands&mdash;two people young enough to take one
      another seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me tell you something,&rdquo; she said, facing him, white hands loosely
      linked behind her. &ldquo;I don't exactly understand how it has happened, but
      you know as well as I do that we have formed a&mdash;an acquaintance&mdash;the
      sort that under normal conditions requires a long time and several
      conventional and preliminary chapters.... I should like to know what you
      think of our performance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said laughing, &ldquo;that it is charming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; men usually find the unconventional agreeable. What I want to
      know is why I find it so, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; A dull colour stained his cheek-bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I do. Is it because I've had a delightful chance to admonish a
      sinner&mdash;and be&mdash;just a little sorry&mdash;that he had made such
      a silly spectacle of himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, wincing a trifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hence this agreeably righteous glow suffusing me,&rdquo; she concluded. &ldquo;So now
      that I have answered my own question, I think that we had better go.
      ...Don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked for a while, subdued, soberly picking their path through the
      dusk. After a few moments she began to feel doubtful, a little uneasy,
      partly from a reaction which was natural, partly because she was not at
      all sure what either Quarrier or Major Belwether would think of the terms
      she was already on with Siward. Suppose they objected? She had never
      thwarted either of these gentlemen. Besides she already had a temporary
      interest in Siward&mdash;the interest that women always cherish, quite
      unconsciously, for the man whose shortcomings they have consented to
      overlook.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they crossed the headland, through the deepening dusk the acetylene
      lamps on a cluster of motor cars spread a blinding light across the scrub.
      The windows of Shotover House were brilliantly illuminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our shooting-party has returned,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They crossed the drive through the white glare of the motor lamps; people
      were passing, grooms with dogs and guns and fluffy bunches of game-birds,
      several women in motor costumes, veils afloat, a man or two in
      shooting-tweeds or khaki.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they entered the hall together, she turned to him, an indefinable smile
      curving her lips; then, with a little nod, friendly and sweet, she left
      him standing at the open door of the gun-room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III SHOTOVER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first person he encountered in the gun-room was Quarrier, who favoured
      him with an expressionless stare, then with a bow, quite perfunctory and
      non-committal. It was plain enough that he had not expected to meet Siward
      at Shotover House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kemp Ferrall, a dark, stocky, active man of forty, was in the act of
      draining a glass, when, though the bottom he caught sight of Siward. He
      finished in a gulp, and advanced, one muscular hand outstretched: &ldquo;Hello,
      Stephen! Heard you'd arrived, tried the Scotch, and bolted with Sylvia
      Landis! That's all right, too, but you should have come for the opening
      day. Lots of native woodcock&mdash;eh, Blinky?&rdquo; turning to Lord Alderdene;
      and again to Siward: &ldquo;You know all these fellows&mdash;Mortimer yonder&mdash;&rdquo;
       There was the slightest ring in his voice; and Leroy Mortimer, red-necked,
      bulky, and heavy eyed, emptied his glass and came over, followed by Lord
      Alderdene blinking madly though his shooting-goggles and showing all his
      teeth like a pointer with a &ldquo;tic.&rdquo; Captain Voucher, a gentleman with the
      vivid colouring of a healthy groom on a cold day, came up, followed by the
      Page boys, Willis and Gordon, who shook hands shyly, enchanted to be on
      easy terms with the notorious Mr. Siward. And last of all Tom O'Hara
      arrived, reeking of the saddle and clinking a pair of trooper's spurs over
      the floor&mdash;relics of his bloodless Porto Rico campaign with Squadron
      A.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was patent to every man present that the Kemp Ferralls had determined
      to ignore Siward's recent foolishness, which indicated that he might
      reasonably expect the continued good-will of several sets, the orbits of
      which intersected in the social system of his native city. Indeed, the few
      qualified to snub him cared nothing about the matter, and it was not
      likely that anybody else would take the initiative in being disagreeable
      to a young man, the fortunes and misfortunes of whose race were part of
      the history of Manhattan Island. Siwards, good or bad, were a matter of
      course in New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      So everybody in the gun-room was civil enough, and he chose Scotch and
      found a seat beside Alderdene, who sat biting at a smoky pipe and
      fingering a tumbler of smokier Scotch, blinking away like mad through his
      shooting-goggles at everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These little brown snipe you call woodcock,&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;we bagged nine
      brace, d'you see? But of all the damnable bogs and covers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rotten,&rdquo; said Mortimer thickly; &ldquo;Ferrall, you're all calf and biceps, and
      it's well enough for you to go floundering into bogs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you expect to find native woodcock?&rdquo; demanded Ferrall, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the table hereafter,&rdquo; growled Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go and pot Beverly Plank's tame pheasants,&rdquo; retorted Ferrall amiably;
      &ldquo;Captain Voucher had a blank day, but he isn't kicking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; said Voucher; &ldquo;the sport is capital&mdash;if one can manage to
      hit the beggars&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, everybody misses in snap-shooting,&rdquo; observed Ferrall; &ldquo;that is,
      everybody except Stephen Siward with his unholy left barrel. Crack! and,&rdquo;
       turning to Alderdene, &ldquo;it's like taking money from you, Blinky&mdash;which
      reminds me that we've time for a little Preference before dressing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His squinting lordship declined and took an easier position in his chair,
      extending a pair of little bandy legs draped in baggy tweed knickerbockers
      and heather-spats. Mortimer, industriously distending his skin with
      whiskey, reached for the decanter. The aromatic perfume of the spirits
      aroused Siward, and he instinctively nodded his desire to a servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This salt air keeps one thirsty,&rdquo; he observed to Ferrall; then something
      in his host's expression arrested the glass at his lips. He had already
      been using the decanter a good deal; except Mortimer, nobody was doing
      that sort of thing as freely as he.
    </p>
    <p>
      He set his glass on the table thoughtfully; a tinge of colour had crept
      into his lean checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferrall, too, suddenly uncomfortable, stood up saying something about
      dressing; several men arose a trifle stiffly, feeling in every joint the
      result of the first day's shooting after all those idle months. Mortimer
      got up with an unfeigned groan; Siward followed, leaving his glass
      untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      One or two other men came in from the billiard-room. All greeted Siward
      amiably&mdash;all excepting one who may not have seen him&mdash;an
      elderly, pink, soft gentleman with white downy chop-whiskers and the
      profile of a benevolent buck rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Major Belwether?&rdquo; said Siward in a low voice without
      offering his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Major Belwether saw him, bless you! yes indeed! And though Siward
      continued not to offer his hand, Major Belwether meant to have it, bless
      your heart! And he fussed and fussed and beamed cordiality until he
      secured it in his plump white fingers and pressed it effusively.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something about his soft, warm hands which had always reminded
      Siward of the temperature and texture of a newly hatched bird. It had been
      some time since he had shaken hands with Major Belwether; it was apparent
      that the bird had not aged any.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now for the shooting!&rdquo; said the Major with an arch smile. &ldquo;Now for
      the stag at bay and the winding horn&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'Where sleeps the moon On Mona's rill&mdash;'
</pre>
    <p>
      Eh, Siward?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'And here's to the hound With his nose upon the ground&mdash;'
</pre>
    <p>
      Eh, my boy? That reminds me of a story&mdash;&rdquo; He chuckled and chuckled,
      his lambent eyes suffused with mirth; and slipping his arm through the
      pivot-sleeve of Lord Alderdene's shooting-jacket, hooking the other in
      Siward's reluctant elbow, and driving Mortimer ahead of him, he went
      garrulously away up the stairs, his lordship's bandy little legs trotting
      beside him, the soaking gaiters and shoes slopping at every step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer, his mottled skin now sufficiently distended, greeted the story
      with a yawn from ear to ear; his lordship, blinking madly, burst into that
      remarkable laugh which seemed to reveal the absence of certain vocal cords
      requisite to perfect harmony; and Siward smiled in his listless, pleasant
      way, and turned off down his corridor, unaware that the Sagamore pup was
      following close at his heels until he heard Quarrier's even, colourless
      voice: &ldquo;Ferrall, would you be good enough to send Sagamore to your
      kennels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;he's your dog! I forgot,&rdquo; said Siward turning around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier looked at him, pausing a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said coldly, &ldquo;he's my dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a fraction of a second the two men's eyes encountered; then Siward
      glanced at the dog, and turned on his heel with the slightest shrug. And
      that is all there was to the incident&mdash;an anxious, perplexed puppy
      lugged off by a servant, turning, jerking, twisting, resisting, looking
      piteously back as his unwilling feet slid over the polished floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Siward walked on alone through the long eastern wing to his room
      overlooking the sea. He sat down on the edge of his bed, glancing at the
      clothing laid out for him. He felt tired and disinclined for the exertion
      of undressing. The shades were up; night quicksilvered the window-panes so
      that they were like a dark mirror reflecting his face. He inspected his
      darkened features curiously; the blurred and sombre-tinted visage returned
      the stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a man at all&mdash;the shadow of a man,&rdquo; he said aloud&mdash;&ldquo;with no
      will, no courage&mdash;always putting off the battle, always avoiding
      conclusions, always skulking. What chance is there for a man like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As one who raises a glass to drink wine and unexpectedly finds water, he
      shrugged his shoulders disgustedly and got up. A bath followed; he dressed
      leisurely, and was pacing the room, fussing with his collar, when Ferrall
      knocked and entered, finding a seat on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen,&rdquo; he said bluntly, &ldquo;I haven't seen you since that break of yours
      at the club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rotten, wasn't it?&rdquo; commented Siward, tying his tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly. Of course it doesn't make any difference to Grace or to me,
      but I fancy you've already heard from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. All I care about is how my mother took it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; she was cut up I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you know how she would look at a thing of that sort; not that any of
      the nine and seventy jarring sets would care, but those few thousands
      invading the edges, butting in&mdash;half or three-quarters inside&mdash;are
      the people who can't afford to overlook the victim of a fashionable club's
      displeasure&mdash;those, and a woman like my mother, and several other
      decent-minded people who happen to count in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferrall, his legs swinging busily, thought again; then: &ldquo;Who was the girl,
      Stephen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think the papers mentioned her name,&rdquo; said Siward gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;I beg your pardon; I thought she was some notorious actress&mdash;everybody
      said so.... Who were those callow fools who put you up to it?... Never
      mind if you don't care to tell. But it strikes me they are candidates for
      club discipline as well as you. It was up to them to face the governors I
      think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I think not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferrall, legs swinging busily, considered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; he mused; &ldquo;they need not have dropped you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they had to. But as long as the Lenox takes no action I can live that
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferrall nodded: &ldquo;I came in to say something&mdash;a message from Grace&mdash;confound
      it! what was it? Oh&mdash;could you&mdash;before dinner&mdash;now&mdash;just
      sit down and with that infernal facility of yours make a sketch of a man
      chasing a gun-shy dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why yes&mdash;if Mrs. Ferrall wishes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked over to the desk in his shirt-sleeves, sat down, drew a blank
      sheet of paper toward him, and, dipping his pen, drew carelessly a gun-shy
      setter dog rushing frantically across the stubble, and after him,
      bare-headed, gun in hand, the maddest of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put a Vandyke beard on him,&rdquo; grinned Ferrall over his shoulder. &ldquo;There! O
      Lord! but you have hit it! Put a ticked saddle on the cur&mdash;there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this supposed to be?&rdquo; began Siward, looking up. But &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;
       chuckled his host, seizing the still wet sketch, and made for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Siward strolled into the bath-room, washed a spot or two of ink from his
      fingers, returned and buttoned his waistcoat, then, completing an
      unhurried toilet, went out and down the stairway to the big living-room.
      There were two or three people there&mdash;Mrs. Leroy Mortimer, very
      fetching with her Japanese-like colouring, black hair and eyes that
      slanted just enough; Rena Bonnesdel, smooth, violet-eyed, blonde, and
      rather stunning in a peculiarly innocent way; Miss Caithness, very pale
      and slimly attractive; and the Page boys, Willis and Gordon, delightfully
      shy and interested, and having a splendid time with any woman who could
      afford the intellectual leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Siward spoke pleasantly to them all. Other people drifted down&mdash;Marion
      Page who looked like a school-marm and rode like a demon; Eileen Shannon,
      pink and white as a thorn blossom, with the deuce to pay lurking in her
      grey eyes; Kathryn Tassel and Mrs. Vendenning whom he did not know, and
      finally his hostess Grace Ferrall with her piquant, almost boyish,
      freckled face and sweet frank eyes and the figure of an adolescent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave Siward one pretty sun-browned hand and laid the other above his,
      holding it a moment in her light clasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen! Stephen!&rdquo; she said under her breath, &ldquo;it's because I've a few
      things to scold you about that I've asked you to Shotover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I know,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope you do. I've a letter to-night from your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From my mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to go over it&mdash;with me&mdash;if we can find a minute
      after dinner.&rdquo; She released his hand, turning partly around: &ldquo;Kemp,
      dinner's been announced, so cut that dog story in two! Will you give me
      your arm Major Belwether? Howard!&rdquo;&mdash;to her cousin, Mr. Quarrier, who
      turned from Miss Landis to listen&mdash;&ldquo;will you please try to recollect
      whom you are to take in&mdash;and do it?&rdquo; And, as she passed Siward, in a
      low voice, mischievous and slangy: &ldquo;Sylvia Landis for yours&mdash;as she
      says she didn't have enough of you on the cliffs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The others appeared to know how to pair according to some previous notice.
      Siward turned to Sylvia Landis with the pleasure of his good fortune so
      plainly visible in his face, that her own brightened in response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said gaily, &ldquo;you cannot escape me. There is no use in
      looking wildly at Agatha Caithness&rdquo;&mdash;he wasn't&mdash;&ldquo;or pretending
      you're pleased,&rdquo; slipping her rounded, bare arm through the arm he
      offered. &ldquo;You can't guess what I've done to-night&mdash;nobody can guess
      except Grace Ferrall and one other person. And if you try to look happy
      beside me, I may tell you&mdash;somewhere between sherry and cognac&mdash;Oh,
      yes; I've done two things: I have your dog for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Sagamore?&rdquo; he said incredulously as he was seating her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly Sagamore. I said to Mr. Quarrier, 'I want Sagamore,' and when
      he tried to give him to me, I made him take my cheque. Now you may draw
      another for me at your leisure, Mr. Siward. Tell me, are you pleased?&rdquo;&mdash;for
      she was looking for the troubled hesitation in his face and she saw it
      dawning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Quarrier doesn't like me, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do,&rdquo; she said coolly. &ldquo;I told him how much pleasure it would give
      me. That is sufficient&mdash;is it not?&mdash;for everybody concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knew that you meant to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that concerns only you and me. Are you trying to spoil my pleasure in
      what I have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't take the dog, Miss Landis&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, vexed; &ldquo;I had no idea you were vindictive&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence; he bent forward a trifle, gravely scrutinising a
      &ldquo;hand-painted&rdquo; name card, though it might not have astonished him to learn
      that somebody's foot had held the brush. Somewhere in the vicinity Grace
      Ferrall had discovered a woman who supported dozens of relatives by
      painting that sort of thing for the summer residents at Vermillion Point
      down the coast. So being charitable she left an order, and being thrifty,
      insisted on using the cards, spite of her husband's gibes.
    </p>
    <p>
      People were now inspecting them with more or less curiosity; Siward found
      his &ldquo;hand-painting&rdquo; so unattractive that he had just tipped it over to
      avoid seeing it, when a burst of laughter from Lord Alderdene made
      everybody turn. Mrs. Vendenning was laughing; so was Rena Bonnesdel
      looking over Quarrier's shoulder at a card he was holding&mdash;not one of
      the &ldquo;hand-decorated,&rdquo; but a sheet of note-paper containing a drawing of a
      man rushing after a gun-shy dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extraordinary cackling laughter of his lordship obliterated other
      sounds for a while; Rena Bonnesdel possessed herself of the drawing and
      held it up amid a shout of laughter. And, to his excessive annoyance,
      Siward saw that, unconsciously, he had caricatured Quarrier&mdash;Ferrall's
      malicious request for a Vandyke beard making the caricature dreadfully
      apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier had at first flushed up; then he forced a smile; but his
      symmetrical features were never cordial when he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who on earth did that?&rdquo; whispered Sylvia Landis apprehensively. &ldquo;Mr.
      Quarrier dislikes that sort of thing&mdash;but of course he'll take it
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he ever chase his own dog?&rdquo; asked Siward, biting his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;so Blinky says&mdash;in the Carolinas last season. It's Blinky!&mdash;that's
      his notion of humour. Did you ever hear such a laugh? No wonder Mr.
      Quarrier is annoyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gay uproar had partly subsided, renewed here and there as the sketch
      was passed along, and finally, making the circle, returned like a bad
      penny to Quarrier. He smiled again, symmetrically, as he received it,
      nodding his compliments to Alderdene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; cackled his lordship; &ldquo;I didn't draw it, old chap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I! I only wish I could,&rdquo; added Captain Voucher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I&mdash;nor I&mdash;who did it?&rdquo; ran the chorus along the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't do it!&rdquo; said Sylvia gravely, looking across at Quarrier. And
      suddenly Quarrier's large, handsome eyes met Siward's for the briefest
      fraction of a second, then were averted. But into his face there crept an
      expressionless pallor that did not escape Siward&mdash;no, nor Sylvia
      Landis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently under cover of a rapid fire of chatter she said: &ldquo;Did you draw
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I had no idea it was meant for him. You may imagine how likely I'd
      be to take any liberty with a man who already dislikes me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it resembles him&mdash;in a very dreadful way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it. You must take my word for what I have told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him: &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; Then: &ldquo;It's a pity; Mr. Quarrier does not
      consider such things humourous. He&mdash;he is very sensitive.... Oh, I
      wish that fool Englishman had been in Ballyhoo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he didn't do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but he put you up to it&mdash;or Grace Ferrall did. I wish Grace
      would let Mr. Quarrier alone; she has always been perfectly possessed to
      plague him; she seems unable to take him seriously and he simply hates it.
      I don't think he'd tolerate her if she were not his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm awfully sorry,&rdquo; was all Siward said; and for a while he gloomily
      busied himself with whatever was brought to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't look that way,&rdquo; came a low voice beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I show everything as plainly as that?&rdquo; he asked, curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seem to read you&mdash;sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very nice of you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To look at me&mdash;now and then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried resentfully, &ldquo;don't be grateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;really am not you know,&rdquo; he said laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she rejoined slowly, &ldquo;is the truth. You say conventional things in
      a manner&mdash;in an agreeably personal manner that interests women. But
      you are not grateful to anybody for anything; you are indifferent, and you
      can't help being nice to people, so&mdash;some day&mdash;some girl will
      think you are grateful, and will have a miserable time of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miserable time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiting for you to say what never will enter your head to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flirt? No, I mean that you don't flirt; that you are always dreamily
      occupied with your own affairs, from which listlessly congenial
      occupation, when drawn, you are so unexpectedly nice that a girl
      immediately desires to see how nice you can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a charming indictment you draw!&rdquo; he said, amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a grave one I assure you. I've been talking about you to Grace
      Ferrall; I asked to be placed beside you at dinner; I told her I hadn't
      had half enough of you on the cliff. Now what do you think of yourself for
      being too nice to a susceptible girl? I think it's immoral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both were laughing now; several people glanced at them, smiling in
      sympathy. Alderdene took that opportunity to revert to the sketch,
      furnishing a specimen of his own inimitable laughter as a running
      accompaniment to the story of Quarrier and his dog in North Carolina,
      until he had everybody, as usual, laughing, not at the story but at him.
      All of which demonstration was bitterly offensive to Quarrier. He turned
      his eyes once on Miss Landis and on Siward, then dropped them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hostess arose; a rustle and flurry of silk and lace and the scraping
      of chairs, a lingering word or laugh, and the colour vanished from the
      room leaving a circle of men in black standing around the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there a man, lighting a cigarette, bolted his coffee and cognac
      and strolled out to the gun-room. Ferrall, gesticulating vigorously,
      resumed his preprandial dog story to Captain Voucher; Belwether
      buttonholed Alderdene and bored him with an interminably facetious tale
      until that nobleman, threatened with maxillary dislocation, fairly
      wrenched himself loose and came over to Siward, squinting furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old ass!&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;his chop whiskers look like the chops of a
      Southdown ram&mdash;and he's got the wits of one. Look here, Stephen, I
      hear you fell into no end of a scrape in town&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tu quoque, Blinky? Oh, read the newspapers and let it go at that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you like old chap!&rdquo; returned his lordship unabashed. &ldquo;All I meant
      was&mdash;anything Voucher and I can do&mdash;of course&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're very good. I'm not dead you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Not dead, you know',&rdquo; repeated Major Belwether coming up behind them
      with his sprightly step; &ldquo;that reminds me of a good one&mdash;&rdquo; He sat
      down and lighted a cigar, then, vainly attempting to control his
      countenance as though roguishly anticipating the treat awaiting them, he
      began another endless story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tradition had hallowed the popular notion that Major Belwether was a wit.
      The sycophant of the outer world seldom even awaited his first word before
      bursting into premature mirth. Besides he was very wealthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Siward watched him with mixed emotions; the lambent-eyed, sheepy
      expression had given place to the buck rabbit; his smooth baby-pink skin
      and downy white side whiskers quivered in premature sympathy with his
      listener's overwhelming hilarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Page boys, very callow, very much delighted, and a little in awe of
      such a celebrated personage, laughed heartily. And altogether there was
      sufficient attention and sufficient laughter to make a very respectable
      noise. This, being the major's cue for an exit, he rose, one sleek hand
      raised in sprightly protest as though to shield the invisible ladies, to
      whose bournes he was bound, from an uproar too masculine and mighty for
      the ears of such a sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ass!&rdquo; muttered Alderdene, getting up and pattering about the room in his
      big, shiny pumps. &ldquo;Give me a peg&mdash;somebody!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer swallowed his brandy, lingered, lifted the decanter, mechanically
      considering its remaining contents and his own capacity; then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bridge, Captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Captain Voucher briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go and shoo the major into the gun-room,&rdquo; observed Ferrall&mdash;&ldquo;unless&mdash;&rdquo;
       looking questioningly at Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've a date with your wife,&rdquo; observed that young man, strolling toward
      the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Page boys, Rena Bonnesdel, and Eileen Shannon were seated at a card
      table together, very much engaged with one another, the sealed pack lying
      neglected on the green cloth, a vast pink box of bon-bons beside it, not
      neglected.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Hara and Quarrier with Marion Page and Mrs. Mortimer were immersed in
      the game, already stony faced and oblivious to outer sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the rooms were distributed girls en tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte, girls eating
      bon-bons and watching the cards&mdash;among them Sylvia Landis, hands
      loosely clasped behind her, standing at Quarrier's elbow to observe and
      profit by an expert performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Siward strolled in she raised her dainty head for an instant, smiled in
      silence, and resumed a study of her fiancÃ©'s game.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later, when Quarrier had emerged brilliantly from the mÃªlÃ©e, she
      looked up again, triumphantly, supposing Siward was lingering somewhere
      waiting to join her. And she was just a trifle surprised and disappointed
      to find him nowhere in sight. She had wished him to observe the brilliancy
      of Mr. Quarrier's game.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Siward, outside on the veranda, was saying at that moment to his
      hostess: &ldquo;I shall be very glad to read my mother's letter at any time you
      choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be later, Stephen. I'm to cut in when Kemp sends for me. He has a
      lot of letters to attend to.... Tell me, what do you think of Sylvia
      Landis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like her, of course,&rdquo; he replied pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace Ferrall stood thinking a moment: &ldquo;That sketch you made proved a
      great success, didn't it?&rdquo; And she laughed under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did it? I thought Mr. Quarrier seemed annoyed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? What a muff that cousin of mine is. He's such a muff, you know,
      that the very sight of his pointed beard and pompadour hair and his
      complacency sets me in fidgets to stir him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you'd best use me for the stick next time,&rdquo; said Siward.
      &ldquo;He's not my cousin you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ferrall shrugged her boyish shoulders: &ldquo;By the way&rdquo;&mdash;she said
      curiously&mdash;&ldquo;who was that girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What girl,&rdquo; he asked coolly, looking at his hostess, now the very
      incarnation of delicate mockery with her pretty laughing mouth, her boyish
      sunburn and freckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't tell me I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she pretty, Stephen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said sulkily; &ldquo;I wish you wouldn't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Do you think I'm going to let you off without some sort of
      confession? If I had time now&mdash;but I haven't. Kemp has business
      letters: he'll be furious; so I've got to take his cards or we won't have
      any pennies to buy gasoline for our adored and shrieking Mercedes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She retreated backward with a gay nod of malice, turned to enter the
      house, and met Sylvia Landis face to face in the hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You minx!&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;aren't you ashamed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much, dear. What for?&rdquo; And catching sight of Siward outside in the
      starlight, divined perhaps something of her hostess' meaning, for she
      laughed uneasily, like a child who winces under a stern eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't suppose for a moment,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;that I have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes I do. You always do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with that sort of man,&rdquo; she returned naÃ¯vely; &ldquo;he won't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ferrall regarded her suspiciously: &ldquo;You always pick out exactly the
      wrong man to play with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had moved back side by side into the hall, the hostess' arm linked in
      the arm of the younger girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wrong man?&rdquo; repeated Sylvia, instinctively freeing her arm, her
      straight brows beginning to bend inward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean that&mdash;exactly. You know how much I care for his mother&mdash;and
      for him.&rdquo; The obstinate downward trend of the brows, the narrowing blue
      gaze signalled mutiny to the woman who knew her so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is so wrong with Mr. Siward?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. There was an affair&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This spring in town. I know it. Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;for the present,&rdquo; replied Grace Ferrall uncomfortably; then:
      &ldquo;For goodness' sake, Sylvia, don't cross examine me that way! I care a
      great deal for that boy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I. I've made him take my dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an abrupt pause, and presently Mrs. Ferrall began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it&mdash;really,&rdquo; said Sylvia quietly; &ldquo;I like him immensely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest, you mean it generously&mdash;with your usual exaggeration. You
      have heard that he has been foolish, and because he's so young, so
      likable, every instinct, every impulse in you is aroused to&mdash;to be
      nice to him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if that were&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no harm, dear&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Ferrall hesitated, her grey eyes
      softening to a graver revery. Then looking up: &ldquo;It's rather pathetic,&rdquo; she
      said in a low voice. &ldquo;Kemp thinks he's foredoomed&mdash;like all the
      Siwards. It's an hereditary failing with him,&mdash;no, it's hereditary
      damnation. Siward after Siward, generation after generation you know&mdash;&rdquo;
       She bit her lip, thinking a moment. &ldquo;His grandfather was a friend of my
      grand-parents, brilliant, handsome, generous, and&mdash;doomed! His own
      father was found dying in a dreadful resort in London where he had
      wandered when stupefied&mdash;a Siward! Think of it! So you see what that
      outbreak of Stephen's means to those whose families have been New Yorkers
      since New York was. It is ominous, it is more than ominous&mdash;it means
      that the master-vice has seized on one more Siward. But I shall never,
      never admit it to his mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The younger girl sat wide-eyed, silent; the elder's gaze was upon her, but
      her thoughts, remote, centred on the hapless mother of such a son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such indulgence was once fashionable; moderation is the present fashion.
      Perhaps he will fall into line,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ferrall thoughtfully. &ldquo;The main
      thing is to keep him among people, not to drop him. The gregarious may be
      shamed, but if anything, any incident, happens to drive him outside by
      himself, if he should become solitary, there's not a chance in the world
      for him.... It's a pity. I know he meant to make himself the exception to
      the rule&mdash;and look! Already one carouse of his has landed him in the
      daily papers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia flushed and looked up: &ldquo;Grace, may I ask you a plain question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, child,&rdquo; she answered absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it occurred to you that what you have said about this boy touches me
      very closely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ferrall's wits returned nimbly from woolgathering, and she shot a
      startled, inquiring glance at the girl beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you mean the matter of heredity, Sylvia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I think my uncle Major Belwether chose you as his august mouthpiece
      for that little sermon on the dangers of heredity&mdash;the danger of
      being ignorant concerning what women of my race had done&mdash;before I
      came into the world they found so amusing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you several things,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Ferrall composedly. &ldquo;Your uncle
      thought it best for you to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The marriage vows sat lightly upon some of my ancestors, I gather.
      In fact,&rdquo; she added coolly, &ldquo;where the women of my race loved they usually
      found the way&mdash;rather unconventionally. There was, if I understood
      you, enough of divorce, of general indiscretion and irregularity to
      seriously complicate any family tree and coat of arms I might care to
      claim&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl lifted her pretty bare shoulders. &ldquo;I'm sorry, but could I help
      it? Very well; all I can do is to prove a decent exception. Very well; I'm
      doing it, am I not?&mdash;practically scared into the first solidly
      suitable marriage offered&mdash;seizing the unfortunate Howard with both
      hands for fear he'd get away and leave me alone with only a queer family
      record for company! Very well! Now then, I want to ask you why everybody,
      in my case, didn't go about with sanctimonious faces and dolorous mien
      repeating: 'Her grand-mother eloped! Her mother ran away. Poor child,
      she's doomed! doomed!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvia, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;why didn't they? That's the way they talk about that boy out
      there!&rdquo; She swept a rounded arm toward the veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but he has already broken loose, while you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I&mdash;nearly! Had it not been for you, you know well enough I
      might have run away with that dreadful Englishman at Newport! For I adored
      him&mdash;I did! I did! and you know it. And look at my endless escapes
      from compromising myself! Can you count them?&mdash;all those
      indiscretions when mere living seemed to intoxicate me that first winter&mdash;and
      only my uncle and you to break me in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ferrall slowly, &ldquo;you don't think Mr. Siward is
      getting what is known as a square deal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't. Major Belwether has already hinted&mdash;no, not even that&mdash;but
      has somehow managed to dampen my pleasure in Mr. Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ferrall considered the girl beside her&mdash;now very lovely and
      flushed in her suppressed excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are going to marry somebody else. So why
      become quite so animated about a man you may never again see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall see him if I desire to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not taking the black veil, am I?&rdquo; asked the girl hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the wedding veil, dear. But after all your husband ought to have
      something to suggest concerning a common visiting list&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may suggest&mdash;certainly. In the meantime I shall be loyal to my
      own friends&mdash;and afterward, too,&rdquo; she murmured to herself, as her
      hostess rose, calmly dropping care like a mantle from her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and be good to this poor young man then; I adore rows&mdash;and you'll
      have a few on your hands I'll warrant. Let me remind you that your uncle
      can make it unpleasant for you yet, and that your amiable fiancÃ© has a
      will of his own under his pompadour and silky beard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pity to have it clash with mine,&rdquo; said the girl serenely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ferrall looked at her: &ldquo;Mercy on us! Howard's pompadour would stick
      up straight with horror if he could hear you! Don't be silly; don't for an
      impulse, for a caprice, break off anything desirable on account of a man
      for whom you really care nothing&mdash;whose amiable exterior and
      prospective misfortune merely enlist a very natural and generous sympathy
      in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose that I shall endure interference from anybody?&mdash;from
      my uncle, from Howard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, you are making a mountain out of a mole-hill. Don't be emotional;
      don't let loose impulses that you and I know about, knew about in our
      school years, know all about now, and which you and I have decided must be
      eliminated&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean subdued; they'll always be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; who cares, as long as you have them in leash?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking at one another, the excited colour cooling in the younger girl's
      cheeks, they laughed, one with relief, the other a little ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kemp will be furious; I simply must cut in!&rdquo; said Mrs. Ferrall, hastily
      turning toward the gun-room. Miss Landis looked after her, subdued,
      vaguely repentant, the consciousness dawning upon her that she had
      probably made considerable conversation about nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's been so all day,&rdquo; she thought impatiently; &ldquo;I've exaggerated; I've
      worked up a scene about a man whose habits are not the slightest concern
      of mine. Besides that I've neglected Howard shamefully!&rdquo; She was walking
      slowly, her thoughts outstripping her errant feet, but it seemed that
      neither her thoughts nor her steps were leading her toward the neglected
      gentleman within; for presently she found herself at the breezy veranda
      door, looking rather fixedly at the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stars, shining impartially upon the just and the unjust, illuminated
      the person of Siward, who sat alone, rather limply, one knee crossed above
      the other. He looked up by chance, and, seeing her star-gazing in the
      doorway, straightened out and rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aware of him apparently for the first time, she stepped across the
      threshold meeting his advance half-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you care to go down to the rocks?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;The surf is
      terrific.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I don't think I care&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood listening a moment to the stupendous roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A storm somewhere at sea,&rdquo; he concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it very fine&mdash;the surf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very fine&mdash;and very relentless&mdash;&rdquo; he laughed; &ldquo;it is an
      unfriendly creature, the sea, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had begun to move toward the cliffs, he fell into step beside her;
      they spoke little, a word now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perfume of the mounting sea saturated the night with wild fragrance;
      dew lay heavy on the lawns; she lifted her skirts enough to clear the
      grass, heedless that her silk-shod feet were now soaking. Then at the
      cliffs' edge, as she looked down into the white fury of the surf, the
      stunning crash of the ocean saluted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long while they watched in silence; once she leaned a trifle too far
      over the star-lit gulf and, recoiling, involuntarily steadied herself on
      his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;no swimmer could endure that battering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would there be no chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bent farther outward, fascinated, stirred, by the splendid frenzy of
      the breakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;think&mdash;,&rdquo; he began quietly; then a firm hand fell over her
      left hand; and, half encircled by his arm she found herself drawn back.
      Neither spoke; two things she was coolly aware of, that, urged, drawn by
      something subtly irresistible she had leaned too far out from the cliff,
      and would have leaned farther had he not taken matters into his own
      keeping without apology. Another thing; the pressure of his hand over hers
      remained a sensation still&mdash;a strong, steady, masterful imprint
      lacking hesitation or vacillation. She was as conscious of it as though
      her hand still tightened under his&mdash;and she was conscious, too, that
      nothing of his touch had offended; that there had arisen in her no tremor
      of instinctive recoil. For never before had she touched or suffered a
      touch from a man, even a gloved greeting, that had not in some measure
      subtly repelled her, nor, for that matter, a caress from a woman without a
      reaction of faint discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I in any actual danger?&rdquo; she asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not. But it was too much responsibility for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Any time I wish to break my neck I am to please do it alone in
      future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly&mdash;if you don't mind,&rdquo; he said smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned, shoulder to shoulder, walking back through the drenched
      herbage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said impulsively, &ldquo;is not what I said a few moments ago to a
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say a few moments ago to a woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said, Mr. Siward, that I would not leave a&mdash;a certain man to go to
      the devil alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know any man who is going to the devil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; she asked, letting herself go swinging out upon a tide of
      intimacy she had never dreamed of risking&mdash;nor had she the slightest
      idea whither the current would carry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had stopped on the lawn, ankle deep in wet grass, the stars overhead
      sparkling magnificently, and in their ears the outcrash of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean me,&rdquo; he concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up into the lovely face; her eyes were very sweet, very clear&mdash;clear
      with excitement&mdash;but very friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us sit here on the steps a little while, will you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he found a place beside her, one step lower, and she leaned forward,
      elbows on knees, rounded white chin in her palms, the starlight giving her
      bare arms and shoulders a marble lustre and tinting her eyes a deeper
      amethyst.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, innocently untethered, mission and all, she laid her heart quite
      bare&mdash;one chapter of it. And, like other women-errant who believe in
      the influence of their sex individually and collectively, she began wrong
      by telling him of her engagement&mdash;perhaps to emphasise her pure
      disinterestedness in a crusade for principle only. Which naturally
      dampened in him any nascent enthusiasm for being ministered to, and so
      preoccupied him that he turned deaf ears to some very sweet platitudes
      which might otherwise have impressed him as discoveries in philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Officially her creed was the fashionable one in town; privately she had
      her own religion, lacking some details truly enough, but shaped upon
      youthful notions of right and wrong. As she had not read very widely, she
      supposed that she had discovered this religion for herself; she was not
      aware that everybody else had passed that way&mdash;it being the first
      immature moult in young people after rejecting dogma.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the ripened fruit of all this philosophy she helpfully dispensed for
      Siward's benefit as bearing directly on his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he not been immersed in the unexpected proposition of her impending
      matrimony, he might have been impressed, for the spell of her beauty
      counted something, and besides, he had recently formulated for himself a
      code of ethics, tinctured with Omar, and slightly resembling her own
      discoveries in that dog-eared science.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was, when she was most eloquent, most earnestly inspired&mdash;nay
      in the very middle of a plea for sweetness and light and simple living,
      that his reasonings found voice in the material comment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never imagined you were engaged!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that what you have been thinking about?&rdquo; she asked, innocently
      astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Why not? I never for one instant supposed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mr. Siward, why should you have concerned yourself with supposing
      anything? Why indulge in any speculation of that sort about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, but I didn't,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you didn't; you'd known me for about three hours&mdash;there on
      the cliff&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;Quarrier&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over his youthful face a sullen shadow had fallen&mdash;flickering, not
      yet settled. He would not for anything on earth have talked freely to the
      woman destined to be Quarrier's wife. He had talked too much anyway.
      Something in her, something about her had loosened his tongue. He had made
      a plain ass of himself&mdash;that was all,&mdash;a garrulous ass. And
      truly it seemed that the girl beside him, even in the starlight, could
      follow and divine what he had scarcely expressed to himself; or her
      instincts had taken a shorter cut to forestall his own conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't think the things you are thinking!&rdquo; she said in a fierce little
      voice, leaning toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked, taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know! Don't! It is unfair&mdash;it is&mdash;is faithless&mdash;to me.
      I am your friend; why not? Does it make any difference to you whom I
      marry? Cannot two people remain in accord anyway? Their friendship
      concerns each other and&mdash;nobody else!&rdquo; She was letting herself go
      now; she was conscious of it, conscious that impulse and emotion were the
      currents unloosed and hurrying her onward. And with it all came
      exhilaration, a faint intoxication, a delicate delight in daring to let go
      all and trust to impulse and emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you feel hurt because for a moment you let me see&mdash;gave
      me a glimpse of yourself&mdash;of life's battle as you foresee it? What if
      there is always a reaction from all confidences exchanged? What if that
      miserable French cynic did say that never was he more alone than after
      confessing to a friend? He died crazy anyhow. Is not a rare moment of
      confidence worth the reaction&mdash;the subsidence into the armored shell
      of self? Tell me truly, Mr. Siward, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Breathless, confused, exhilarated by her own rapid voice she bent her
      face, brilliant with colour, and very sweet; and he looked up into it,
      expectant, uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If such a friendship as ours is to become worth anything to you&mdash;to
      me, why should it trouble you that I know&mdash;and am thinking of things
      that concern you? Is it because the confidence is one-sided? Is it because
      you have given and I have listened and given nothing in return to balance
      the account? I do give&mdash;interest, deep interest, sympathy if you ask
      it; I give confidence in return&mdash;if you desire it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can a girl like you need of sympathy?&rdquo; he said smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know! you don't know! If heredity is a dark vista, and if you
      must stare through it all your life, sword in hand, always on your guard,
      do you think you are the only one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you&mdash;one?&rdquo; he said incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;with an involuntary shudder&mdash;&ldquo;not that way. It is easier
      for me; I think it is&mdash;I know it is. But there are things to combat&mdash;impulses,
      a recklessness, perhaps something almost ruthless. What else I do not
      know, for I have never experienced violent emotions of any sort&mdash;never
      even deep emotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thoroughly,&rdquo; she added with conviction, &ldquo;but not violently. I&mdash;&rdquo;
       she hesitated, stopped short, leaning forward, peering at him through the
      dusk; and: &ldquo;Mr. Siward! are you laughing?&rdquo; She rose and he stood up
      instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was lightning in her darkening eyes now; in his something that
      glimmered and danced. She watched it, fascinated, then of a sudden the
      storm broke and they were both laughing convulsively, face to face there
      under the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Siward,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;I don't know what I am laughing at; do you?
      Is it at you? At myself? At my poor philosophy in shreds and tatters? Is
      it some infernal mirth that you seem to be able to kindle in me&mdash;for
      I never knew a man like you before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know what you were laughing at?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;It was something
      about love&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No I don't know why I laughed! I&mdash;I don't wish to, Mr. Siward. I do
      not desire to laugh at anything you have made me say&mdash;anything you
      may infer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't infer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do! You made me say something&mdash;about my being ignorant of deep,
      of violent emotion, when I had just informed you that I am thoroughly,
      thoroughly in love&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I make you say all that, Miss Landis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did. Then you laughed and made me laugh too. Then you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I do then?&rdquo; he asked, far too humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you infer that I am either not in love or incapable of it, or
      too ignorant of it to know what I'm talking about. That, Mr. Siward, is
      what you have done to me to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I'm sorry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to be anyway,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was unfortunate; an utterly inexcusable laughter seemed to bewitch
      them, hovering always close to his lips and hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you laugh!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How dare you! I don't care for you nearly
      as violently as I did, Mr. Siward. A friendship between us would not be at
      all good for me. Things pass too swiftly&mdash;too intimately. There is
      too much mockery in you&mdash;&rdquo; She ceased suddenly, watching the sombre
      alteration of his face; and, &ldquo;Have I hurt you?&rdquo; she asked penitently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I, Mr. Siward? I did not mean it.&rdquo; The attitude, the words,
      slackening to a trailing sweetness, and then the moment's silence, stirred
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm rather ignorant myself of violent emotion,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suspect
      normal people are. You know better than I do whether love is usually a
      sedative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I normal&mdash;after what I have confessed?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Can't love be
      well-bred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly I should say&mdash;only perhaps you are not an expert&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In self-analysis, for example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a vague meaning in the gaze they exchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for our friendship, we'll do the best we can for it, no matter what
      occurs,&rdquo; he added, thinking of Quarrier. And, thinking of him, glanced up
      to see him within ear-shot and moving straight toward them from the
      veranda above.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence; a tentative civil word from Siward; then Miss
      Landis took command of something that had a grotesque resemblance to a
      situation. A few minutes later they returned slowly to the house, the girl
      walking serenely between Siward and her preoccupied affianced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your shoes are as wet as my skirts and slippers you had better change,
      Mr. Siward,&rdquo; she said, pausing at the foot of the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he took his congÃ©, leaving her standing there with Quarrier, and
      mounted to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the corridor he passed Ferrall, who had finished his business
      correspondence and was returning to the card-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's a letter that Grace wants you to see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Read it before
      you turn in, Stephen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; but I'll be down later,&rdquo; replied Siward passing on, the letter
      in his hand. Entering his room he kicked off his wet pumps and found dry
      ones. Then moved about, whistling a gay air from some recent vaudeville,
      busy with rough towels and silken foot-gear, until, reshod and dry, he was
      ready to descend once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The encounter, the suddenly informal acquaintance with this young girl had
      stirred him agreeably, leaving a slight exhilaration. Even her engagement
      to Quarrier added a tinge of malice to his interest. Besides he was young
      enough to feel the flattery of her concern for him&mdash;of her rebuke, of
      her imprudence, her generous emotional and childish philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, as like recognises like, he recognised in her the instincts of
      the born drifter, momentarily at anchor&mdash;the temporary inertia of the
      opportunist, the latent capacity of an unformed character for all things
      and anything. Add to these her few years, her beauty, and the wholesome
      ignorance so confidently acknowledged, what man could remain unconcerned,
      uninterested in the development of such possibilities? Not Siward, amused
      by her sagacious and impulsive prudence, worldliness, and innocence in
      accepting Quarrier; and touched by her profitless, frank, and unworldly
      friendliness for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that he objected to her marrying Quarrier; he rather admired her for
      being able to do it, considering the general scramble for Quarrier. But
      let that take care of itself; meanwhile, their sudden and capricious
      intimacy had aroused him from the morbid reaction consequent upon the
      cheap notoriety which he had brought upon himself. Let him sponge his
      slate clean and begin again a better record, flattered by the solicitude
      she had so prettily displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whistling under his breath the same gay, empty melody, he opened the top
      drawer of his dresser, dropped in his mother's letter, and locking the
      drawer, pocketed the key. He would have time enough to read the letter
      when he went to bed; he did not just now feel exactly like skimming
      through the fond, foolish sermon which he knew had been preached at him
      through his mother's favourite missionary, Grace Ferrall. What was the use
      of dragging in the sad old questions again&mdash;of repeating his
      assurances of good behaviour, of reiterating his promises of moderation
      and watchfulness, of explaining his own self-confidence? Better that the
      letter await his bed time&mdash;his prayers would be the sincerer the
      fresher the impression; for he was old-fashioned enough to say the prayers
      that an immature philosophy proved superfluous. For, he thought, if prayer
      is any use, it takes only a few minutes to be on the safe side.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he went down-stairs leisurely, prepared to acquiesce in any suggestion
      from anybody, but rather hoping to saunter across Sylvia Landis' path
      before being committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing beside the fire with Quarrier, one foot on the fender,
      apparently too preoccupied to notice him; so he strolled into the
      gun-room, which was blue with tobacco smoke and aromatic with the volatile
      odours from decanters.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a few women there, and the majority of the men. Lord Alderdene,
      Major Belwether, and Mortimer were at a table by themselves; stacks of
      ivory chips and five cards spread in the centre of the green explained the
      nature of their game; and Mortimer, raising his heavy inflamed eyes and
      seeing Siward unoccupied, said wheezily: &ldquo;Cut out that 'widow,' and give
      Siward his stack! Anything above two pairs for a jack triples the ante.
      Come on, Siward, there's a decent chap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he seated himself for a sacrifice to the blind goddess balanced upon
      her winged wheel; and the cards ran high&mdash;so high that stacks
      dwindled or toppled within the half-hour, and Mortimer grew redder and
      redder, and Major Belwether blander and blander, and Alderdene's face wore
      a continual nervous snicker, showing every white hound's tooth, and the
      ice in the tall glasses clinked ceaselessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late when Quarrier &ldquo;sat in,&rdquo; with an expressionless acknowledgment
      of Siward's presence, and an emotionless raid upon his neighbour's
      resources with the first hand dealt, in which he participated without
      drawing a card.
    </p>
    <p>
      And always Siward, eyes on his cards, seemed to see Quarrier before him,
      his overmanicured fingers caressing his silky beard, the symmetrical
      pompadour dark and thick as the winter fur on a rat, tufting his smooth
      blank forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very late when Siward first began to be aware of his increasing
      deafness, the difficulty, too, that he had in making people hear, the
      annoying contempt in Quarrier's woman-like eyes. He felt that he was
      making a fool of himself, very noiselessly somehow&mdash;but with more
      racket than he expected when he miscalculated the distance between his
      hand and a decanter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was time for him to go&mdash;unless he chose to ask Quarrier for an
      explanation of that sneer which he found distasteful. But there was too
      much noise, too much laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides he had a matter to attend to&mdash;the careful perusal of his
      mother's letter to Mrs. Ferrall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very white, he rose. After an indeterminate interval he found himself
      entering his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was in the dresser; several things seemed to fall and break,
      but he got the letter, sank down on the bed's edge and strove to read,&mdash;set
      his teeth grimly, forcing his blurred eyes to a focus. But he could make
      nothing of it&mdash;nor of his toilet either, nor of Ferrall, who came in
      on his way to bed having noticed the electricity still in full glare over
      the open transom, and who straightened out matters for the stunned man
      lying face downward across the bed, his mother's letter crushed in his
      nerveless hand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV THE SEASON OPENS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Breakfast at Shotover, except for the luxurious sluggards to whom trays
      were sent, was served in the English fashion&mdash;any other method or
      compromise being impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferrall, reasonable in most things, detested customs exotic, and usually
      had an Englishman or two about the house to tell them so, being unable to
      jeer in any language except his own. Which is partly why Alderdene and
      Voucher were there. And this British sideboard breakfast was a concession
      wrung from him through force of sheer necessity, although the custom had
      already become practically universal in American country houses where
      guests were entertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the British breakfast he drew the line. No army of servants, always
      in evidence, would he tolerate, either; no highly ornamented human
      bric-Ã -brac decorating halls and corners; no exotic pheasants hustled into
      covert and out again; no fusillade at the wretched, frightened, bewildered
      aliens dumped by the thousand into unfamiliar cover and driven toward the
      guns by improvised beaters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We walk up our game or we follow a brace of good dogs in this white man's
      country,&rdquo; he said with unnecessary emphasis whenever his bad taste and his
      wife's absence gave him an opportunity to express to the casual foreigner
      his personal opinions on field sport. &ldquo;You'll load your own guns and
      you'll use your own legs if you shoot with me; and your dogs will do their
      own retrieving, too. And if anybody desires a Yankee's opinion on shooting
      driven birds from rocking-chairs or potting tame deer from grand-stands,
      they can have it right now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Usually nobody wanted his further opinion; and sometimes they got it and
      sometimes not, if his wife was within earshot. Otherwise Ferrall appeared
      to be a normal man, energetically devoted to his business, his pleasures,
      his friends, and comfortably in love with his wife. And if some considered
      his vigour in business to be lacking in mercy, that vigour was always
      exercised within the law. He never transgressed the rules of war, but his
      headlong energy sometimes landed him close to the dead line. He had
      already breakfasted, when the earliest risers entered the morning room to
      saunter about the sideboards and investigate the simmering contents of
      silver-covered dishes on the warmers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fragrance of coffee was pleasantly perceptible; men in conventional
      shooting attire roamed about the room, selected what they cared for, and
      carried it to the table. Mrs. Mortimer was there consuming peaches that
      matched her own complexion; Marion Page, always more congruous in field
      costume and belted jacket than in anything else, and always, like her own
      hunters, minutely groomed, was preparing a breakfast for her own
      consumption with the leisurely precision characteristic of her whether in
      the saddle, on the box, or grassing her brace of any covey that ever
      flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Voucher and Lord Alderdene discussed prospects between bites,
      attentive to the monosyllabic opinions of Miss Page. Her twin brothers,
      Gordon and Willis, shyly consuming oatmeal, listened respectfully and
      waited on their sister at the slightest lifting of her thinly arched
      eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this company sauntered Siward, apparently no worse for wear. For as
      yet the Enemy had set upon him no proprietary insignia save a rather
      becoming pallor and faint bluish shadows under the eyes. He strolled
      about, exchanging amiable greetings, and presently selected a chilled
      grape fruit as his breakfast. Opposite him Mortimer, breakfasting upon his
      own dreadful bracer of an apple soaked in port, raised his heavy inflamed
      eyes with a significant leer at the iced grape fruit. For he was always
      ready to make room upon his own level for other men; but the wordless grin
      and the bloodshot welcome were calmly ignored, for as yet that freemasonry
      evoked no recognition from the pallid man opposite, whose hands were
      steady as though that morning's sun had wakened him from pleasant dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most difficult shot in the world,&rdquo; Alderdene was explaining, &ldquo;is an
      incoming pheasant, sailing on a slant before a gale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woodcock in alders doing a jack-snipe twist is worse,&rdquo; grunted
      Mortimer, drenching another apple in port.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Page tersely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or a depraved ruffed cock-grouse in the short pines; isn't that the
      limit?&rdquo; asked Mortimer of Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Siward only shrugged his comment and glanced out through the leaded
      casements into the brilliant September sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside he could see Major Belwether, pink skinned, snowy chop whiskers
      brushed rabbit fashion, very voluble with Sylvia Landis, who listened
      absently, head partly averted. Quarrier in tweeds and gaiters, his morning
      cigar delicately balanced in his gloved fingers, strolled near enough to
      be within ear-shot; and when Sylvia's inattention to Major Belwether's
      observations became marked to the verge of rudeness, he came forward and
      spoke. But whatever it was that he said appeared to change her passive
      inattention to quiet displeasure, for, as Siward rose from the table, he
      saw her turn on her heel and walk slowly toward a group of dogs presided
      over by some kennel men and gamekeepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was talking to the head gamekeeper when he emerged from the house, but
      she saw him on the terrace and gave him a bright nod of greeting, so close
      to an invitation that he descended the stone steps and crossed the dew-wet
      lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am asking Dawson to explain just exactly what a 'Shotover Drive'
      resembles,&rdquo; she said, turning to include Siward in an animated conference
      with the big, scraggy, head keeper. &ldquo;You know, Mr. Siward, that it is a
      custom peculiar to Shotover House to open the season with what is called a
      Shotover Drive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard Alderdene talking about it,&rdquo; he said, smilingly inspecting the
      girl's attire of khaki with its buttoned pockets, gun pads, and Cossack
      cartridge loops, and the tan knee-kilts hanging heavily pleated over
      gaiters and little thick-soled shoes. He had never cared very much to see
      women afield, for, in a rare case where there was no affectation, there
      was something else inborn that he found unpleasant&mdash;something lacking
      about a woman who could take life from frightened wild things, something
      shocking that a woman could look, unmoved, upon a twitching, blood-soiled
      heap of feathers at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Dawson, dog-whip at salute, stood knee deep among his restless
      setters, explaining the ceremony with which Mr. Ferrall ushered in the
      opening of each shooting season:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's our own idee, Miss Landis,&rdquo; he said proudly; &ldquo;onc't a season Mr.
      Ferrall and his guests likes it for a mixed bag. 'Tis a sort of picnic,
      Miss; the guns is in pairs, sixty yards apart in line, an' the rules is,
      walk straight ahead, dogs to heel until first cover is reached; fire
      straight or to quarter, never blankin' nor wipin' no eyes; and ground game
      counts as feathers for the Shotover Cup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! It's a skirmish line that walks straight ahead?&rdquo; said Siward,
      nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight ahead, Sir. No stoppin', no turnin' for hedges, fences, water or
      rock. There is boats f'r deep water and fords marked and corduroy f'r to
      pass the Seven Dreens. Luncheon at one, Miss&mdash;an hour's rest&mdash;then
      straight on over hill, valley, rock, and river to the rondyvoo atop Osprey
      Ledge. You'll see the poles and the big nests, Sir. It's there they score
      for the cup, and there when the bag is counted, the traps are ready to
      carry you home again.&rdquo;... And to Siward: &ldquo;Will you draw for your lady,
      Sir? It is the custom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you my 'lady'?&rdquo; he asked, turning to Sylvia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the smiling lustre of her eyes the tiniest spark flashed out at him&mdash;a
      hint of defiance for somebody, perhaps for Major Belwether who had taken
      considerable pains to enlighten her as to Siward's condition the night
      before; perhaps also for Quarrier, who had naturally expected to act as
      her gun-bearer in emergencies. But the gaily veiled malice of the one had
      annoyed her, and the cold assumption of the other had irritated her, and
      she had, scarcely knowing why, turned her shoulder to both of these
      gentlemen with an indefinite idea of escaping a pressure, amounting almost
      to critical importunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm probably a poor shot?&rdquo; she said, looking smilingly, straight into
      Siward's eyes. &ldquo;But if you'll take me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will with pleasure,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;Dawson, do we draw for position? Very
      well then&rdquo;; and he drew a slip of paper from the box offered by the head
      keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Number seven!&rdquo; said Sylvia, looking over his shoulder. &ldquo;Come out to the
      starting line, Mr. Siward. All the positions are marked with golf-discs.
      What sort of ground have we ahead, Dawson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind o' stiff, Miss,&rdquo; grinned the keeper. &ldquo;Pity your gentleman ain't
      drawed the meadows an' Sachem Hill line. Will you choose your dog, Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have your dog, you know,&rdquo; observed Sylvia demurely. And Siward,
      glancing among the impatient setters, saw one white, heavily feathered
      dog, straining at his leash, and wagging frantically, brown eyes fixed on
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment Sagamore was free, devouring his master with caresses, the
      girl looking on in smiling silence; and presently, side by side, the man,
      the girl, and the dog were strolling off to the starting line where
      already people were gathering in groups, selecting dogs, fowling-pieces,
      comparing numbers, and discussing the merits of their respective lines of
      advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferrall, busily energetic, and in high spirits, greeted them gaily,
      pointing out the red disc bearing their number, seven, where it stood out
      distinctly above the distant scrub of the foreland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You two are certainly up against it!&rdquo; he said, grinning. &ldquo;There's only
      one rougher line, and you're in for thorns and water and a scramble across
      the back-bone of the divide!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it any good?&rdquo; asked Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good&mdash;if you've got the legs and Sylvia doesn't play baby&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; she said indignantly. &ldquo;Kemp, you annoy me. And I will bet you now,&rdquo;
       she added, flushing, &ldquo;that your old cup is ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Siward, laughing, &ldquo;we may not shoot straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will! Kemp, I'll wager whatever you dare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gloves? Stockings?&mdash;against a cigarette case?&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done,&rdquo; she said disdainfully, moving forward along the skirmish line with
      a nod and smile for the groups now disintegrating into couples, the Page
      boys with Eileen Shannon and Rena Bonnesdel, Marion Page followed by
      Alderdene, Mrs. Vendenning and Major Belwether and the Tassel girl
      convoyed by Leroy Mortimer. Farther along the line, taking post, she saw
      Quarrier and Miss Caithness, Captain Voucher with Mrs. Mortimer, and
      others too distant to recognise, moving across country with glitter and
      glint of sunlight on slanting gun barrels.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Ferrall was climbing into his saddle beside his pretty wife, who
      sat her horse like a boy, the white flag lifted high in the sunshine,
      watching the firing line until the last laggard was in position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Grace!&rdquo; said Ferrall briskly. Down went the white flag; the
      far-ranged line started into motion straight across country, dogs at heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      From her saddle Mrs. Ferrall could see the advance, strung out far afield
      from the dark spots moving along the Fells boundary, to the two couples
      traversing the salt meadows to north. Crack! A distant report came faintly
      over the uplands against the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Voucher,&rdquo; observed Ferrall; &ldquo;probably a snipe. Hark! he's struck them
      again, Grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ferrall, watching curiously, saw Siward's gun fly up as two big dark
      spots floated up from the marsh and went swinging over his head. Crack!
      Crack! Down sheered the black spots, tumbling earthward out of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duck,&rdquo; said Ferrall; &ldquo;a double for Stephen. Lord Harry! how that man can
      shoot! Isn't it a pity that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said no more; his pretty wife astride her thoroughbred sat silent, grey
      eyes fixed on the distant figures of Sylvia Landis and Siward, now
      shoulder deep in the reeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it&mdash;very bad last night?&rdquo; she asked in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferrall shrugged. &ldquo;He was not offensive; he walked steadily enough
      up-stairs. When I went into his room he lay on the bed as if he'd been
      struck by lightning. And yet&mdash;you see how he is this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After a while,&rdquo; his wife said, &ldquo;it is going to alter him some day&mdash;dreadfully&mdash;isn't
      it, Kemp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;like Mortimer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;only Leroy was always a pig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they turned their horses toward the high-road Mrs. Ferrall said: &ldquo;Do
      you know why Sylvia isn't shooting with Howard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied her husband indifferently; &ldquo;do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; She looked out across the sunlit ocean, grave grey eyes brightening
      with suppressed mischief. &ldquo;But I half suspect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all sorts of things, Kemp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's one of 'em?&rdquo; asked Ferrall, looking around at her; but his wife
      only laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean she's throwing her flies at Siward&mdash;now that you've
      hooked Quarrier for her! I thought she'd played him to the gaff&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don't be coarse, Kemp,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ferrall, sending her horse
      forward. Her husband spurred to her side, and without turning her head she
      continued: &ldquo;Of course Sylvia won't be foolish. If they were only safely
      married; but Howard is such a pill&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does Sylvia expect with Howard's millions? A man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace Ferrall drew bridle. &ldquo;The curious thing is, Kemp, that she liked
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likes him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, liked him. I saw how it was; she took his silences for intellectual
      meditation, his gallery, his library, his smatterings for expressions of a
      cultivated personality. Then she remembered how close she came to running
      off with that cashiered Englishman, and that scared her into clutching the
      substantial in the shape of Howard.... Still, I wish I hadn't meddled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meddled how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I told her to do it. We had talks until daylight.... She may marry
      him&mdash;I don't know&mdash;but if you think any live woman could be
      contented with a muff like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's immoral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kemp, I'm not. She'd be mad not to marry him; but I don't know what I'd
      do to a man like that, if I were his wife. And you know what a terrific
      capacity for mischief there is in Sylvia. Some day she's going to love
      somebody. And it isn't likely to be Howard. And, oh, Kemp! I do grow so
      tired of that sort of thing. Do you suppose anybody will ever make decency
      a fashion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're doing your best,&rdquo; said Ferrall, laughing at his wife's pretty,
      boyish face turned back toward him over her shoulder; &ldquo;you're presenting
      your cousin and his millions to a girl who can dress the part&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't, Kemp! I don't know why I meddled!... I wish I hadn't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. You can't let Howard alone! You're perfectly possessed to plague
      him when he's with you, and now you've arranged for another woman to keep
      it up for the rest of his lifetime. What does Sylvia want with a man who
      possesses the instincts and intellect of a coachman? She is asked
      everywhere, she has her own money. Why not let her alone? Or is it too
      late?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean let her make a fool of herself with Stephen Siward? That is
      where she is drifting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do. She has a perfect genius for selecting the wrong man; and
      she's already sorry for this one. I'm sorry for Stephen, too; but it's
      safe for me to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She might make something of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know perfectly well no woman ever did make anything of a doomed man.
      He'd kill her&mdash;I mean it, Kemp! He would literally kill her with
      grief. She isn't like Leila Mortimer; she isn't like most girls of her
      sort. You men think her a rather stunning, highly tempered, unreasonable
      young girl, with a reserve of sufficiently trained intelligence to marry
      the best our market offers&mdash;and close her eyes;&mdash;a thoroughbred
      with the caprices of one, but also with the grafted instinct for proper
      mating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's all right, isn't it?&rdquo; asked Ferrall. &ldquo;That's the way I size
      her up. Isn't it correct?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in a way. She has all the expensive training of the thoroughbred&mdash;and
      all the ignorance, too. She is cold-blooded because wholesome; a trifle
      sceptical because so absolutely unawakened. She never experienced a deep
      emotion. Impulses have intoxicated her once or twice&mdash;as when she
      asked my opinion about running off with Cavendish, and that boy and girl
      escapade with Rivington; nothing at all except high mettle, the innocent
      daring lurking in all thoroughbreds, and a great deal of very red blood
      racing through that superb young body. But,&rdquo; Ferrall reined in to listen,
      &ldquo;but if ever a man awakens her&mdash;I don't care who he is&mdash;you'll
      see a girl you never knew, a brand-new creature emerge with the last rags
      and laces of conventionality dropping from her; a woman, Kemp, heiress to
      every generous impulse, every emotion, every vice, every virtue of all
      that brilliant race of hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to know,&rdquo; he said, amused and curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. Major Belwether told me that he had thought of Howard as an
      anchor for her. It seemed a pity&mdash;Howard with all his cold, heavy
      negative inertia.... I said I'd do it. I did. And now I don't know; I
      wish, almost wish I hadn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has changed your ideas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Howard is safer than Stephen Siward, already in the first
      clutches of his master-vice. Would you mate what she inherits from her
      mother and her mother's mother, with what is that poor boy's heritage from
      the Siwards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; observed Ferrall dryly, &ldquo;we're not in the angel-breeding
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to be. Every decent person ought to be. If they were, inherited
      vice would be as rare in this country as smallpox!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People don't inherit smallpox, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind! You know what I mean. In our stock farms and kennels, we weed
      out, destroy, exterminate hereditary weakness in everything. We pay the
      greatest attention to the production of all offspring except our own. Look
      at Stephen! How dared his parents bring him into the world? Look at
      Sylvia! And now, suppose they marry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; said Ferrall, &ldquo;my head is a whirl and my wits are spinning like
      five toy tops. Your theories are all right; but unless you and I are
      prepared to abandon several business enterprises and take to the lecture
      platform, I'm afraid people are going to be wicked enough to marry whom
      they like, and the human race will he run as usual with money the
      favourite, and love a case of 'also-ran.'... By the way, how dared you
      marry me, knowing the sort of demon I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gathering frown on Mrs. Ferrall's brow faded; she raised her clear
      grey eyes and met her husband's gaze, gay, humourous, and with a hint of
      tenderness&mdash;enough to bring the colour into her pretty face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I'm right, Kemp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always, dear. And now that we have the world off our hands for a few
      minutes, suppose we gallop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she held her horse to a walk, riding forward, grave, thoughtful,
      preoccupied with a new problem, only part of which she had told her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that night she had been awakened in her bed to find standing beside
      her a white, wide-eyed figure, shivering, limbs a-chill beneath her
      clinging lace. She had taken the pallid visitor to her arms and warmed her
      and soothed her and whispered to her, murmuring the thousand little words
      and sounds, the breathing magic mothers use with children. And Sylvia lay
      there, chilled, nerveless, silent, ignorant why her sleeplessness had
      turned to restlessness, to loneliness, to an awakening perception of what
      she lacked and needed and began to desire. For that sad void, peopled at
      intervals through her brief years with a vague mother-phantom, had, in the
      new crisis of her career, become suddenly an empty desolation, frightening
      her with her own utter isolation. Fill it now she could not, now that she
      needed that ghost of child-comfort, that shadowy refuge, that sweet shape
      she had fashioned out of dreams to symbolise a mother she had never known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Driven she knew not why, she had crept from her room in search of the
      still, warm, fragrant nest and the whispered reassurance and the caress
      she had never before endured. Yes, now she craved it, invited it, longed
      for safe arms around her, the hovering hand on her hair. Was this Sylvia?
    </p>
    <p>
      And Grace Ferrall, clearing her sleepy eyes, amazed, incredulous of the
      cold, child-like hands upon her shoulders, caught her in her arms with a
      little laugh and sob and drew her to her breast, to soothe and caress and
      reassure, to make up to her all she could of what is every child's just
      heritage.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for a long while Sylvia, lying there, told her nothing&mdash;because
      she did not know how&mdash;merely a word, a restless question half
      ashamed, barely enough to shadow forth the something stirring her toward
      an awakening in a new world, where with new eyes she might catch glimpses
      of those dim and splendidly misty visions that float through sunlit
      silences when a young girl dreams awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at length, gravely, innocently, she spoke of her engagement, and the
      worldly possibilities before her; of the man she was to marry, and her new
      and unexpected sense of loneliness in his presence, now that she had seen
      him again after months.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke, presently, of Siward&mdash;a fugitive question or two, offered
      indifferently at first, then with shy persistence and curiosity, knowing
      nothing of the senseless form flung face downward across the sheets in a
      room close by. And thereafter the murmured burden of the theme was Siward,
      until one, heavy eyed, turned from the white dawn silvering the windows,
      sighed, and fell asleep; and one lay silent, head half buried in its
      tangled gold, wide awake, thinking vague thoughts that had no ending, no
      beginning. And at last a rosy bar of light fell across the wall, and the
      warm shadows faded from corner and curtain; and, turning on the pillow,
      her face nestled in her hair, she fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing of this had Mrs. Ferrall told her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in her life had Sylvia suffered the caresses most women
      invite or naturally lavish; for the first time had she attempted
      confidences, failing because she did not know how, but curiously contented
      with the older woman's arms around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a change in Sylvia, a great change stealing in upon her as she
      lay there, breathing like a child, flushed lips scarcely parted. Through
      the early slanting sunlight the elder woman, leaning on one arm, looked
      down at her, grey eyes very grave and tender&mdash;wise, sweet eyes that
      divined with their pure clairvoyance all that might happen or might fail
      to come to pass in this great change stealing over Sylvia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing of this could her husband understand had she words to convey it.
      There was nothing he need understand except that his wife, meaning well,
      had meddled and regretted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, turning in her saddle with a pretty gesture of her shoulders:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meddle no more! Those who need me may come to me. Now laugh at my tardy
      wisdom, Kemp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no laughing matter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you're going to stand back and let
      this abandoned world spin itself madly to the bow-wows&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be horrid. I repent. The mischief take Howard Quarrier!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen! Come on, Grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gathered bridle. &ldquo;Do you suppose Stephen Siward is going to make
      trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can he unless she helps him? Nonsense! All's well with Siward and
      Sylvia. Shall we gallop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All was very well with Siward and Sylvia. They had passed the rabbit-brier
      country scathless, with two black mallard, a jack-snipe, and a rabbit to
      the credit of their score, and were now advancing through that dimly lit
      enchanted land of tall grey alders where, in the sudden twilight of the
      leaves, woodcock after woodcock fluttered upward twittering, only to stop
      and drop, transformed at the vicious crack of Siward's gun to fluffy balls
      of feather whirling earthward from mid-air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sagamore came galloping back with a soft, unsoiled mass of chestnut and
      brown feathers in his mouth. Siward took the dead cock, passed it back to
      the keeper who followed them, patted the beautiful eager dog and signalled
      him forward once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have fired that time,&rdquo; he said to Sylvia&mdash;&ldquo;that is, if
      you care to kill anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't seem to be able to,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It isn't a bit like shooting
      at clay targets. The twittering whirr takes me by surprise&mdash;it's all
      so charmingly sudden&mdash;and my heart seems to stop in one beat, and I
      look and look and then&mdash;whisk! the woodcock is gone, leaving me
      breathless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice ceased; the white setter, cutting up his ground ahead, had
      stopped, rigid, one leg raised, jaws quivering and locking alternately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't that a stunning picture!&rdquo; said Siward in a low voice. &ldquo;What a
      beauty he is&mdash;like a statue in white and blue-veined marble. You may
      talk, Miss Landis; woodcock don't flush at the sound of the human voice as
      grouse do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See his brown eyes roll back at us! He wonders why we don't do
      something!&rdquo; whispered the girl. &ldquo;Look, Mr. Siward! Now his head is moving&mdash;oh
      so gradually to the left!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bird is moving on the ground,&rdquo; nodded Siward; &ldquo;now the bird has
      stopped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do wish I could see a woodcock on the ground,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;Do you
      think we might by any chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward noiselessly sank to his knees and crouched, keen eyes minutely busy
      among the shadowy browns and greys of wet earth and withered leaf. And
      after a while, cautiously, he signalled the girl to kneel beside him, and
      stretched out one arm, forefinger extended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sight straight along my arm,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as though it were a rifle
      barrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her soft cheek rested against his shoulder; a stray strand of shining hair
      brushing his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under that bunch of fern,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;just the colour of the dead
      leaves. Do you see?... Don't you see that big woodcock squatted flat, bill
      pointed straight out and resting on the leaves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a long while she saw, suddenly, and an exquisite little shock
      tightened her fingers on Siward's extended arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the feathered miracle!&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;the wonder of its cleverness
      to hide like that! You look and look and stare, seeing it all the while
      and not knowing that you see it. Then in a flash it is there, motionless,
      a brown-shaped shadow among shadows.... The dear little thing!... Mr.
      Siward, do you think&mdash;are you going to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won't shoot it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.... Might I sit here a moment to watch it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seated herself soundlessly among the dead leaves; he sank into place
      beside her, laying his gun aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather rough on the dog,&rdquo; he said with a grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. It is very good of you, Mr. Siward to do this for my pleasure. Oh&mdash;h!
      Do you see! Oh, the little beauty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woodcock had risen, plumage puffed out, strutting with wings bowed and
      tail spread, facing the dog. The sudden pigmy defiance thrilled her.
      &ldquo;Brave! Brave!&rdquo; she exclaimed, enraptured; but at the sound of her voice
      the bird crouched like a flash, large dark liquid eyes shining, long bill
      pointed straight toward them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll fly the way his bill points,&rdquo; said Siward. &ldquo;Watch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose; she sprang lightly to her feet; there came a whirring flutter, a
      twittering shower of sweet notes, soft wings beating almost in their very
      faces, a distant shadow against the sky, and the woodcock was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quieting the astounded dog, gun cradled in the hollow of his left arm, he
      turned to the girl beside him: &ldquo;That sort of thing wins no cups,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wins something else, Mr. Siward,&mdash;my very warm regard for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no choice between that and the Shotover Cup,&rdquo; he admitted,
      considering her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;do you mean it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do, vigorously!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are much nicer than I thought you.... And after all, if the
      price of a cup is the life of that brave little bird, I had rather shoot
      clay pigeons. Now you will scorn me I suppose. Begin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My ideal woman has never been a life-taker,&rdquo; he said coolly. &ldquo;Once, when
      I was a boy, there was a girl&mdash;very lovely&mdash;my first sweetheart.
      I saw her at the traps once, just after she had killed her seventh pigeon
      straight, 'pulling it down' from overhead, you know&mdash;very clever&mdash;the
      little thing was breathing on the grass, and it made sounds&mdash;&rdquo; He
      shrugged and walked on. &ldquo;She killed her twenty-first bird straight; it was
      a handsome cup, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And after a silence, &ldquo;So you didn't love her any more, Mr. Siward?&rdquo;&mdash;mockingly
      sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      They laughed, and at the sound of laughter the tall-stemmed alders echoed
      with the rushing roar of a cock-grouse thundering skyward. Crack! Crack!
      Whirling over and over through a cloud of floating feathers, a heavy
      weight struck the springy earth. There lay the big mottled bird, splendid
      silky ruffs spread, dead eyes closing, a single tiny crimson bead
      twinkling like a ruby on the gaping beak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; said Siward to the dog who had dropped to shot; &ldquo;Fetch!&rdquo; And,
      signalling the boy behind, he relieved the dog of his burden and tossed
      the dead weight of ruffled plumage toward him. Then he broke his gun, and,
      as the empty shells flew rattling backward, slipped in fresh cartridges,
      locked the barrels, and walked forward, the flush of excitement still
      staining his sunburnt face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You deal death mercifully,&rdquo; said the girl in a low voice. &ldquo;I wonder what
      your ci-devant sweetheart would think of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bungler had better stick to the traps,&rdquo; he assented, ignoring the
      badinage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am wondering,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully, &ldquo;what I think of men who kill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned sharply, hesitated, shrugged. &ldquo;Wild things' lives are brief at
      best&mdash;fox or flying-tick, wet nests or mink, owl, hawk, weasel or
      man. But the death man deals is the most merciful. Besides,&rdquo; he added,
      laughing, &ldquo;ours is not a case of sweethearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My argument is purely in the abstract, Mr. Siward. I am asking you
      whether the death men deal is more justifiable than a woman's gift of
      death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, life-taking, the giving of life&mdash;there can be only one
      answer to the mystery; and I don't know it,&rdquo; he replied smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me then,&rdquo; he said, still amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had passed swale after swale of silver birches waist deep in perfumed
      fern and brake; the big timber lay before them. She moved forward, light
      gun swung easily across her leather-padded shoulder; and on the wood's
      sunny edge she seated herself, straight young back against a giant pine,
      gun balanced across her flattened knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are feeling the pace a little,&rdquo; he said, coming up and standing in
      front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pace? No, Mr. Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a trifle&mdash;bored?&rdquo; She considered him in silence, then leaned
      back luxuriously, rounded arms raised, wrists crossed to pillow her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is charmingly new to me,&rdquo; she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Not the open?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have camped and done the usual roughing it with only three guides
      apiece and the champagne inadequately chilled. I have endured that sort of
      hardship several times, Mr. Siward.... What is that furry hunch up there
      in that tall thin tree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A raccoon,&rdquo; he said presently. &ldquo;Can you see the foxy head peeping so
      slyly down at us? Look at Sagamore nosing the air in that droll blind
      mole-like way. He knows there's something furry up aloft somewhere; and he
      knows it's none of his business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They watched the motionless ball of fur in the crotch of a slim forest
      elm. Presently it uncurled, cautiously; a fluffy ringed tail unfolded; the
      rounded furry back humped up, and the animal, moving slowly into the
      tangent foliage of an enormous oak, vanished amid bronzing leafy depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence the birds began to reappear. A jay screamed somewhere deep
      in the yellowing woods; black-capped chickadees dropped from twig to twig,
      cheeping inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat listening, bright head pillowed in her arms, idly attentive to his
      low running comment on beast and bird and tree, on forest stillness and
      forest sounds, on life and the wild laws of life and death governing the
      great out-world 'twixt sky and earth. Sunlight and shadows moving, speech
      and silence, waxed and waned. A listless contentment lay warm upon her,
      weighting the heavy white lids. The blue of her eyes was very dark now&mdash;almost
      purple like the colour of the sea when the wind-flaws turn the blue to
      violet.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Did you ever hear of the 'Lesser Children'?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Listen then:

     &ldquo;'Multitudes, multitudes, under the moon they stirred!
     The weakerbrothers of our earthly breed;
     All came about my head and at my feet
     A thousand thousand sweet,
     With starry eyes not even raised to plead:
     Bewildered, driven, hiding, fluttering, mute!
     And I beheld and saw them one by one
     Pass, and become as nothing in the night.'
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Do you know what it means?

     &ldquo;'Winged mysteries of song that from the sky
     Once dashed long music down&mdash;'
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Do you understand?&rdquo; she asked, smiling.

     &ldquo;'Who has not seen in the high gulf of light
     What, lower, was a bird!'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      She ceased, and, raising her eyes to his: &ldquo;Do you know that plea for mercy
      on the lesser children who die all day to-day because the season opens for
      your pleasure, Mr. Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a woodland sermon?&rdquo; he inquired, too politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poem? No; it is the case for the prosecution. The prisoner may defend
      himself if he can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The defence rests,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The prisoner moves that he be discharged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Motion denied,&rdquo; she interrupted promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere in the woodland world the crows were holding a noisy session,
      and she told him that was the jury debating the degree of his guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you're guilty of course,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I wonder what your
      sentence is to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll leave it to you,&rdquo; he suggested lazily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I sentenced you to slay no more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'd appeal&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use; I am the tribunal of last resort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I throw myself upon the mercy of the court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do well, Mr. Siward. This court is very merciful.... How much do you
      care for bird murder? Very much? Is there anything you care for more? Yes?
      And could this court grant it to you in compensation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said, deliberately, roused by the level challenge of her gaze: &ldquo;The
      court is incompetent to compensate the prisoner or offer any compromise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the court herself is already compromised in her future
      engagements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what has my&mdash;engagement to do with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You offered compensation for depriving me of my shooting. There could be
      only one adequate compensation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that?&rdquo; she asked, coolly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your continual companionship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have it, Mr. Siward&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it for a day. The season lasts three months you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you and I are to play a continuous vaudeville for three months? Is
      that your offer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then one day with me is not worth those many days of murder?&rdquo; she asked
      in pretended astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask yourself why those many days would be doubly empty,&rdquo; he said so
      seriously that the pointless game began to confuse her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&rdquo;&mdash;she turned lightly from uncertain ground&mdash;&ldquo;then perhaps
      we had better be about that matter of the cup you prize so highly. Are you
      ready, Mr. Siward? There is much to be killed yet&mdash;including time,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the hinted sweetness of the challenge had aroused him, and he made no
      motion to rise. Nor did she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;just exactly what I should ask of you if
      you insist on taking away&mdash;&rdquo; he turned and looked about him through
      the burnt gold foliage, &ldquo;&mdash;if you took away all this out of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not take it; because I have nothing in exchange to offer... you
      say,&rdquo; she answered imprudently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say so,&rdquo; he retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did&mdash;reminding me that the court is already engaged for a
      continuous performance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it necessary to remind you?&rdquo; he asked with deliberate malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed up, vexed, silent, then looked directly at him with beautiful
      hostile eyes. &ldquo;What do you mean, Mr. Siward? Are you taking our harmless,
      idle badinage as warrant for an intimacy unwarranted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I offended?&rdquo; he asked, so impassively that a flash of resentment
      brought her to her feet, angry and self-possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far have we to go?&rdquo; she asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet, turned, hailing the keeper, repeating the question.
      And at the answer they both started forward, the dog ranging ahead through
      a dense growth of beech and chestnut, over a high brown ridge, then down,
      always down along a leafy ravine to the water's edge&mdash;a forest pond
      set in the gorgeous foliage of ripening maples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see,&rdquo; said Sylvia impatiently, &ldquo;how we are going to obey
      instructions and go straight ahead. There must be a stupid boat
      somewhere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the game-laden keeper shook his head, pulled up his hip boots, and
      pointed out a line of alder poles set in the water to mark a crossing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I expected to wade?&rdquo; asked the girl anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This here,&rdquo; observed the keeper, &ldquo;is one of the most sportin' courses on
      the estate. Last season I seen Miss Page go through it like a scared deer&mdash;the
      young lady, sir, that took last season's cup&rdquo;&mdash;in explanation to
      Siward, who stood doubtfully at the water's edge, looking back at Sylvia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raising her dismayed eyes she encountered his; there was a little laugh
      between them. She stepped daintily across the stones to the water's edge,
      instinctively gathering her kilts in one hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miles and I could chair you over,&rdquo; suggested Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that fair&mdash;under the rules?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Miss; as long as you go straight,&rdquo; said the keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they laid aside the guns and the guide's game-sack, and formed a chair
      with their hands, and, bearing the girl between them, they waded out along
      the driven alder stakes, knee-deep in brown water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before them herons rose into heavy flapping flight, broad wings glittering
      in the sun; a diver, distantly afloat among the lily pads, settled under
      the water to his eyes as a submarine settles till the conning-tower is
      awash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her arm, lightly resting around his neck, tightened a trifle as the water
      rose to his thighs; then the faint pressure relaxed as they thrashed
      shoreward through the shallows, ankle deep once more, and landed among the
      dry reeds on the farther bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miles, the keeper, went back for the guns. Siward stamped about in the
      sun, shaking the drops from water-proof breeches and gaiters, only to be
      half drenched again when Sagamore shook himself vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Sylvia, looking sideways at Siward, &ldquo;your contempt for
      my sporting accomplishments has not decreased. I'm sorry; I don't like to
      walk in wet shoes... even to gain your approval.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, as the keeper came splashing across the shallows: &ldquo;Miles, you may
      carry my gun. I shall not need it any longer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The upward roar of a bevey of grouse drowned her voice; poor Sagamore,
      pointing madly in the blackberry thicket all unperceived, cast a dismayed
      glance aloft where the sunlit air quivered under the winnowing rush of
      heavy wings. Siward flung up his gun, heading a big quartering bird;
      steadily the glittering barrels swept in the arc of fire, hesitated,
      wavered; then the possibility passed; the young fellow lowered the gun,
      slowly, gravely; stood a moment motionless with bent head until the rising
      colour in his face had faded.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was all, for a while. The astonished and disgusted keeper stared
      into the thicket; the dog lay quivering, impatient for signal. Sylvia's
      heart, which had seemed to stop with her voice, silenced in the gusty
      thunder of heavy wings, began beating too fast. For the ringing crack of a
      gun shot could have spoken no louder to her than the glittering silence of
      the suspended barrels; nor any promise of his voice sound as the startled
      stillness sounded now about her. For he had made something a trifle more
      than mere amends for his rudeness. He was overdoing everything&mdash;a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood on the thicket's edge, absently unloading the weapon, scarcely
      understanding what he had done and what he had not done.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later a far hail sounded across the uplands, and against the sky
      figures moved distantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alderdene and Marion Page,&rdquo; said Siward. &ldquo;I believe we lunch yonder, do
      we not, Miles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They climbed the hill in silence, arriving after a few minutes to find
      others already at luncheon&mdash;the Page boys, eager, enthusiastic,
      recounting adventure by flood and field; Rena Bonnesdel tired and frankly
      bored and decorated with more than her share of mud; Eileen Shannon, very
      pretty, very effective, having done more execution with her eyes than with
      the dainty fowling-piece beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marion Page nodded to Sylvia and Siward with a crisp, business-like
      question or two, then went over to inspect their bag, nodding approbation
      as Miles laid the game on the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight full brace,&rdquo; she commented. &ldquo;We have five, and an odd cock-pheasant&mdash;from
      Black Fells, I suppose. The people to our left have been blazing away like
      Coney Island, but Rena's guide says the ferns are full of rabbits that
      way, and Major Belwether can't hit fur afoot. You,&rdquo; she added frankly to
      Siward, &ldquo;ought to take the cup. The birches ahead of you are full of
      woodcock. If you don't, Howard Quarrier will. He's into a flight of
      jack-snipe I hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward's eyes had suddenly narrowed; then he laughed, patting Sagamore's
      cheeks. &ldquo;I don't believe I shall shoot very steadily this afternoon,&rdquo; he
      said, turning toward the group at luncheon under the trees. &ldquo;I wish
      Quarrier well&mdash;with the cup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Marion Page curtly; &ldquo;you are the cleanest shot I ever
      knew.&rdquo; And she raised her glass to him, frankly, and emptied it with the
      precision characteristic of her: &ldquo;Your cup! With all my heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I also drink to your success, Mr. Siward,&rdquo; said Sylvia in a low voice,
      lifting her champagne glass in the sunlight. &ldquo;To the Shotover Cup&mdash;if
      you wish it.&rdquo; And as other glasses sparkled aloft amid a gay tumult of
      voices wishing him success, Sylvia dropped her voice, attuning it to his
      ear alone: &ldquo;Success for the cup, if you wish it&mdash;or, whatever you
      wish&mdash;success!&rdquo; and she meant it very kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand resting on his glass he sat, smiling silent acknowledgment to the
      noisy generous toasts; he turned and looked at Sylvia when her low voice
      caught his ear&mdash;looked at her very steadily, unsmiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then to the others, brightening again, he said a word or two, wittily,
      with a gay compliment well placed and a phrase to end it in good taste.
      And, in the little gust of hand-clapping and laughter, he turned again to
      Sylvia, smilingly, saying under his breath: &ldquo;As though winning the cup
      could compensate me now for losing it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned involuntarily nearer: &ldquo;You mean that you will not try for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not fair&mdash;to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;because I do not ask it of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not, now that I know your wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Siward, I&mdash;my wish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she had no chance to finish; already Rena Bonnesdel was looking at
      them, and there was a hint of amused surprise in Eileen Shannon's
      mischievous eyes, averted instantly, with malicious ostentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Marion Page took possession of him so exclusively, so calmly, that
      something in her cool certainty vaguely irritated Sylvia, who had never
      liked her. Besides, the girl showed too plainly her indifference to other
      people; which other people seldom find amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen,&rdquo; called out Alderdene, anxiously counting the web loops in his
      khaki vest, &ldquo;what do you call fair shooting at these damnable ruffed
      grouse? You needn't be civil about it, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five shells to a bird is good shooting,&rdquo; answered Siward. &ldquo;Don't you
      think so, Miss Page?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a better score, Mr. Siward,&rdquo; said Marion Page with a hostile
      glance at Alderdene, who had not made good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was chance&mdash;and this year's birds. I've taken ten shells to an
      old drummer in hard wood or short pines.&rdquo; He smiled to himself, adding: &ldquo;A
      drove of six in the open got off scot free a little while ago. Miss Landis
      saw it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That he was inclined to turn it all to banter relieved her at once. &ldquo;It
      was pitiable,&rdquo; she nodded gravely to Marion; &ldquo;his nerve left him when they
      made such a din in the briers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Page glanced at her indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I need is practice like the chasseurs of Tarascon,&rdquo; admitted Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I willingly offer my hat, monsieur,&rdquo; said Sylvia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marion Page, impatient to start, had turned her tailor-made back to the
      company, and was instructing his crestfallen lordship very plainly: &ldquo;You
      fire too quickly, Blinky; two seconds is what you must count when a grouse
      flushes. You must say 'Mark! Right!' or 'Mark! Left! Bang!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might as well say 'Bang!' for all I've done to-day,&rdquo; he muttered,
      adjusting his shooting-goggles and snapping his eyes like fury. Then
      exploding into raucous laughter he moved off southward with Marion Page,
      who had exchanged a swift handshake with Siward; the twins followed,
      convoying Eileen and Rena, neither maiden excitedly enthusiastic. And so
      the luncheon party, lord and lady, twins and maidens, guides and dogs,
      trailed away across the ridge, distant silhouettes presently against the
      sky, then gone. And after a little while the far, dry, accentless report
      of smokeless powder announced that the opening of the season had been
      resumed and the Lesser Children were dying fast in the glory of a perfect
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready, Mr. Siward?&rdquo; She stood waiting for him at the edge of the
      thicket; Miles resumed his game sack and her fowling-piece; the dog came
      up, looking him anxiously in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he walked forward beside her into the dappled light of the thicket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a few minutes the dog stood twice; and twice the whirring twitter
      of woodcock startled her, echoed by the futile crack of his gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miles,&rdquo; with a glint of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Overshot, sir,&mdash;excusin' the liberty, Mr. Siward. Both marked down
      forty yard to the left if you wish to start 'em again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said indifferently, &ldquo;I had my chance at them. They're exempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Sagamore, tail wildly whipping, came smack on the trail of an old
      stager of a cock-grouse&mdash;on, on over rock, log, wet gully, and dry
      ridge, twisting, doubling, circling, every wile, every trick employed and
      met, until the dog crawling noiselessly forward, trembled and froze, and
      Siward, far to left, wheeled at the muffled and almost noiseless rise. For
      an instant the slanting barrels wavered, grew motionless; but only a stray
      sunbeam glinting struck a flash of cold fire from the muzzle, only the
      feathery whirring whisper broke the silence of suspense. Then far away
      over sunny tree tops a big grouse sailed up, rocketing into the sky on
      slanted wings, breasting the height of green; dipped, glided downward with
      bowed wings stiffened, and was engulfed in the misty barriers of purpling
      woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vale!&rdquo; said Siward aloud, &ldquo;I salute you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came strolling back across the crisp leaves, the dappled sunshine
      playing over his face like the flicker of a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miles,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my nerve is gone. Such things happen. I'm all in. Come
      over here, my friend, and look at the sun with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The discomfited keeper obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where ought that refulgent luminary to scintilate when I face Osprey
      Ledge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sun. How do I hold it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the p'int of your right shoulder, sir.&mdash;You ain't quittin', Mr.
      Siward, sir!&rdquo; anxiously; &ldquo;that Shotover Cup is easy yours, sir!&rdquo; eagerly;
      &ldquo;Wot's a miss on a old drummer, Mr. Siward? Wot's twice over-shootin'
      cock, sir, when a blind dropper can see you are the cleanest, fastest,
      hard-shootin' shot in the null county!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Siward shook his head with an absent glance at the dog, and motioned
      the astonished keeper forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Line the easiest trail for us,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I think we are already a trifle
      tired. Twigs will do in short cover; use a hatchet in the big timber....
      And go slow till we join you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when the unwilling and perplexed keeper had started, Siward, unlocking
      his gun, drew out the smooth yellow cartridges and pocketed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia looked up as the sharp metallic click of the locked breech rang out
      in the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you do this, Mr. Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know; really I am honest; I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could not be because I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; he said, too seriously to reassure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Siward,&rdquo; in quick displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you do for your amusements cannot concern me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right as usual,&rdquo; he said so gaily that a reluctant smile trembled on her
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why have you done this? It is unreasonable&mdash;if you don't feel
      as I do about killing things that are having a good time in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood silent, absently looking at the fowling-piece cradled in his left
      arm. &ldquo;Shall we sit here a moment and talk it over?&rdquo; he suggested
      listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her blue gaze swept him; his vague smile was indifferently bland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are determined not to shoot, we might as well start for Osprey
      Ledge,&rdquo; she suggested; &ldquo;otherwise, what reason is there for our being here
      together, Mr. Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Awaiting his comment&mdash;perhaps expecting a counter-proposition&mdash;she
      leaned against the tree beside which he stood. And after a while, as his
      absent-minded preoccupation continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think the leaves are dry enough to sit on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slipped off his shooting-coat and placed it at the base of the tree.
      She waited for a second, uncertain how to meet an attitude which seemed to
      take for granted matters which might, if discussed, give her at least the
      privilege of yielding. However, to discuss a triviality meant forcing
      emphasis where none was necessary. She seated herself; and, as he
      continued to remain standing, she stripped off her shooting-gloves and
      glanced up at him inquiringly: &ldquo;Well, Mr. Siward, I am literally at your
      feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which redresses the balance a little,&rdquo; he said, finding a place near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very nice of you. Can I always count on you for civil platitudes
      when I stir you out of your day-dreams?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can always count on stirring me without effort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can't. Nobody can. You are never to be counted on; you are too
      absent-minded. Like a veil you wrap yourself in a brown study, leaving
      everybody outside to consider the pointed flattery of your withdrawal.
      What happens to you when you are inside that magic veil? Do you change
      into anything interesting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat there, chin propped on his linked fingers, elbows on knees; and,
      though there was always the hint of a smile in his pleasant eyes, always
      the indefinable charm of breeding in voice and attitude, something now was
      lacking. And after a moment she concluded that it was his attention.
      Certainly his wits were wool-gathering again; his eyes, edged with the
      shadow of a smile, saw far beyond her, far beyond the sunlit shadows where
      they sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his preoccupation she had found him negatively attractive. She glanced
      at him now from time to time, her eyes returning always to the beauty of
      the subdued light where all about them silver-stemmed birches clustered
      like slim shining pillars, crowned with their autumn canopy of crumpled
      gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enchantment!&rdquo; she said under her breath. &ldquo;Surely an enchanted sleeper
      lies here somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;unawakened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asleep? I?&rdquo; She looked around at him. &ldquo;You are the dreamer here. Your
      eyes are full of dreaming even now. What is your desire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned on one arm, watching her; she had dropped her ungloved hand,
      searching among the newly fallen gold of the birch leaves drifted into
      heaps. On the third finger a jewel glittered; he saw it, conscious of its
      meaning&mdash;but his eyes followed the hand idly heaping up autumn gold,
      a white slim hand, smoothly fascinating. Then the little, restless hand
      swept near to his, almost touching it; and then instinctively he took it
      in his own, curiously, lifting it a little to consider its nearer
      loveliness. Perhaps it was the unexpectedness of it, perhaps it was sheer
      amazement that left her hand lying idly relaxed like a white petalled
      blossom in his. His bearing, too, was so blankly impersonal that for a
      moment the whole thing appeared inconsequent. Then, as her hand lay there,
      scarcely imprisoned, their eyes encountered,&mdash;and hers, intensely
      blue now, considered him without emotion, studied him impersonally without
      purpose, incuriously acquiescent, indifferently expectant.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little while the consciousness of the contact disconcerted her;
      she withdrew her fingers with an involuntary shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no chance?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perplexed with her own emotion, the meaning of his low-voiced question at
      first escaped her; then, like its own echo, came ringing back in her ears,
      re-echoed again as he repeated it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no chance for me, Miss Landis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The very revulsion of self-possession returning chilled her; then anger
      came, quick and hot; then pride. She deliberated, choosing her words
      coolly enough: &ldquo;What chance do you mean, Mr. Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fighting chance. Can you give it to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fighting chance? For what?&rdquo;&mdash;very low, very dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, in spite of her, her senses became unsteady; a sudden ringing
      confusion seemed to deafen her, through which his voice, as if very far
      away, sounded again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men who are worth a fighting chance ask for it sometimes&mdash;but take
      it always. I take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her pallor faded under the flood of bright colour; the blue of her eyes
      darkened ominously to velvet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Siward,&rdquo; she said, very distinctly and slowly, &ldquo;I am not&mdash;even&mdash;sorry&mdash;for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my chance is desperate indeed,&rdquo; he retorted coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chance! Do you imagine&mdash;&rdquo; Her anger choked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not a little hard?&rdquo; he said, paling under his tan. &ldquo;I supposed
      women dismissed men more gently&mdash;even such a man as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a full minute she strove to comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a man as you!&rdquo; she repeated vaguely; &ldquo;you mean&mdash;&rdquo; a crimson
      wave dyed her skin to the temples and she leaned toward him in
      horror-stricken contrition; &ldquo;I didn't mean that, Mr. Siward! I&mdash;I
      never thought of that! It had no weight, it was not in my thoughts. I
      meant only that you had assumed what is unwarranted&mdash;that you&mdash;your
      question humiliated me, knowing that I am engaged&mdash;knowing me so
      little&mdash;so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I knew everything. Ask yourself why I risk everything to say this to
      you? There can be only one answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then after a long silence: &ldquo;Have I ever&mdash;&rdquo; she began tremblingly&mdash;&ldquo;ever
      by word or look&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I even&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I've simply discovered how I feel. That's what I was dreaming about
      when you asked me. I was afraid I might do this too soon; but I meant to
      do it anyway before it became too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was too late from the very moment we met, Mr. Siward.&rdquo; And, as he
      reddened painfully again, she added quickly: &ldquo;I mean that I had already
      decided. Why will you take what I say so dreadfully different from the way
      I intend it? Listen to me. I&mdash;I believe I am not very experienced
      yet; I was a&mdash;astonished&mdash;quite stunned for a moment. Then it
      hurt me&mdash;and I said that I was not sorry for you... I am sorry, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, as he said nothing: &ldquo;You were a little rough, a little sudden with
      me, Mr. Siward. Men have asked me that question&mdash;several times; but
      never so soon, so unreasonably soon&mdash;never without some preliminary
      of some sort, so that I could foresee, be more or less prepared.... But
      you gave me no warning. I&mdash;if you had, I would have known how to be
      gentle. I&mdash;I wish to be now. I like you&mdash;enough to say this to
      you, enough to be seriously sorry; if I could bring myself to really
      believe this&mdash;feeling&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still he said nothing; he sat there listlessly studying the sun spots
      glowing, waxing, waning on the carpet of dead leaves at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for&mdash;what you have said,&rdquo; she added, a little smile curving the
      sensitive mouth, &ldquo;it is impulsive, unconsidered, a trifle boyish, Mr.
      Siward. I pay myself the compliment of your sincerity; it is rather nice
      to be a girl who can awaken the romance in a man within a day or two's
      acquaintance.... And that is all it is&mdash;a romantic impulse with a
      pretty girl. You see I am frank; I am really glad that you find me
      attractive. Tell me so, if you wish. We shall not misunderstand each other
      again. Shall we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his head, considering her, forcing the smile to meet her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be better friends than ever,&rdquo; she asserted confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, better than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because what you have done means the nicest sort of friendship, you see.
      You can't escape its duties and responsibilities now, Mr. Siward. I shall
      expect you to spend the greater part of your life in devotedly doing
      things for me. Besides, I am now privileged to worry you with advice. Oh,
      you have invested me with all sorts of powers now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang to her feet, flushed, smiling, a trifle excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it all over, and are we the very ideals of friends?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very ideals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are nice!&rdquo; she said impulsively, holding out both gloveless hands. He
      held them, she looking at him very sweetly, very confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allons! Without malice?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without malice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without afterthoughts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without afterthoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;you are content?&rdquo; persuasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you must be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be,&rdquo; he repeated obediently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are! Say it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it does not make me unhappy not to be contented&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it, please; or&mdash;do you desire me to be unhappy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her small, smooth hands lying between his, they stood confronting one
      another in the golden light. She might easily have brought the matter to
      an end; and why she did not, she knew no more than a kitten waking to
      consciousness under its first caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it,&rdquo; she repeated, laughing uncertainly back into his smiling eyes of
      a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you are contented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Siward, it is unkind, it is shameless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it; I am that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am sorry for you. Look at that!&rdquo; turning her left hand in his so
      that the jewel on the third finger caught the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she observed with composure, &ldquo;is sheer obstinacy.... Isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is what I said it was: a hopeful discontent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can it be?&rdquo; impatiently now, for the long, unaccustomed contact was
      unnerving her&mdash;yet she made no motion to withdraw her hands. &ldquo;How can
      you really care for me? Do you actually believe that&mdash;devotion&mdash;comes
      like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So suddenly? It is impossible!&rdquo; with a twist of her pretty shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did it come&mdash;to you?&rdquo; he asked between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then her face grew scarlet and her eyes grew dark, and her hands
      contracted in his&mdash;tightened, twisted fingers entangled, until, with
      a little sob, she swayed toward him and he caught her. An instant, a
      minute&mdash;more, perhaps, she did not know&mdash;she half lay in his
      arms, her untaught lips cold against his. Lassitude, faint consciousness,
      then tiny shock on shock came the burning revulsion; and her voice came
      back, too, sounding strangely to her, a colourless, monotonous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had freed her; she remembered that somebody had asked him to&mdash;perhaps
      herself. That was well; she needed to breathe, to summon strength and
      common-sense, find out what had been done, what reasonless madness she had
      committed in the half-light of the silver-stemmed trees clustering in
      shameful witness on every hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the hot humiliation of it overwhelmed her, and she covered her
      face with her hands, standing, almost swaying, as wave on wave of
      incredulous shame seemed to sweep her from knee to brow. That phase passed
      after a while; out of it she emerged, flushed, outwardly composed, into
      another phase, in full self-possession once more, able to understand what
      had happened without the disproportion of emotional exaggeration. After
      all, she had only been kissed. Besides she was a novice, which probably
      accounted, in a measure, for the unreasonable emotion coincident with a
      caress to which she was unaccustomed. Without looking up at him she found
      herself saying coolly enough to surprise herself: &ldquo;I never supposed I was
      capable of that. It appears that I am. I haven't anything to say for
      myself... except that I feel fearfully humiliated.... Don't say anything
      now... I do not blame you, truly I do not. It was contemptible of me&mdash;to
      do it&mdash;wearing this&mdash;&rdquo; she stretched out her slender left hand,
      not looking at him; &ldquo;it was contemptible!&rdquo;... She slowly raised her eyes,
      summoning all her courage to face him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he only saw in the pink confusion of her lovely face the dawning
      challenge of a coquette saluting her adversary in gay acknowledgment of
      his fleeting moment of success. And as his face fell, then hardened into
      brightness, instantly she divined how he rated her, and in a flash
      realized her weapons and her security, and that the control of the
      situation was hers, not in the control of this irresolute young man who
      stood so silently considering her. Strange that she should be ashamed of
      her own innocence, willing that he believe her accomplished in such arts,
      enchanted that he no longer perhaps suspected genuine emotion in the
      swift, confused sweetness of her first kiss. If only all that were truly
      hidden from him, if he dare not in his heart convict her of anything save
      perfection in a gay, imprudent rÃ´le, what a weight lifted, what relief,
      what hot self-contempt cooled! What vengeance, too, she would take on him
      for the agony of her awakening&mdash;the dazed chagrin, the dread of his
      wise, amused eyes&mdash;eyes that she feared had often looked upon such
      scenes; eyes no doubt familiar with such unimportant details as the shamed
      demeanour of a novice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you take it so seriously?&rdquo; she said, laughing and studying him,
      certain now of herself in this new disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you take it lightly?&rdquo; he asked, striving to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Ah, I must, you know. You don't expect to marry me... do you, Mr.
      Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; He choked up at that, grimly for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking slowly forward together she fell into step frankly beside him,
      near him&mdash;too near. &ldquo;Try to be sensible,&rdquo; she was saying gaily; &ldquo;I
      like you so much&mdash;and it would be horrid to have you mope, you know.
      And besides, even if I cared for you, there are reasons, you know&mdash;reasons
      for any girl to marry the man I am going to marry. Does my cynicism shock
      you? What am I to do?&rdquo; with a shrug. &ldquo;Such marriages are reasonable, and
      far likelier to be agreeable than when fancy is the sole motive&mdash;certainly
      far more agreeable than an ill-considered yielding to abstract emotion
      with nothing concrete in view.... So, you see, I could not marry you even
      if I&mdash;&rdquo; her voice was inclined to tremble, but she controlled it.
      Would she never learn her rÃ´le? &ldquo;even if I loved you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then her tongue stumbled and was silent; and they walked on, side by side,
      through the fading splendour of the year, exchanging no further speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward sunset their guide hailed them, standing high among the rocks, a
      silhouette against the sky. And beyond him they saw the poles crowned with
      the huge nests of the fish-hawks, marking the last rendezvous at Osprey
      Ledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to him as they started up the last incline, thanking him in a
      sweet, natural voice for his care of her&mdash;quite innocently&mdash;until
      in the questioning, unconvinced gaze that met hers she found her own eyes
      softening and growing dim; and she looked away suddenly, lest he read her
      ere she had dared turn the first page in the book of self&mdash;ere she
      had studied, pried, probed among the pages of a new chapter whose familiar
      title, so long meaningless to her, had taken on a sudden troubling
      significance. And for the first time in her life she glanced uneasily at
      the new page in the book of self, numbered according to her years with the
      figures 23, and headed with the unconvincing chapter title, &ldquo;Love.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER V A WINNING LOSER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The week passed swiftly, day after day echoing with the steady fusillade
      from marsh to covert, from valley to ridge. Guns flashed at dawn and dusk
      along the flat tidal reaches haunted of black mallard and teal; the
      smokeless powder cracked through alder swamp and tangled windfall where
      the brown grouse burst away into noisy blundering flight; where the
      woodcock, wilder now, shrilled skyward like feathered rockets, and the big
      northern hares, not yet flecked with snowy patches of fur, loped off into
      swamps to the sad undoing of several of the younger setters.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pheasant drive at Black Fells to which the Ferralls' guests
      were bidden by Beverly Plank&mdash;a curious scene, where ladies and
      gentlemen stood on a lawn, backed by an army of loaders and gun-bearers,
      while another improvised army of beaters drove some thousands of
      frightened, bewildered, homeless foreign pheasants at the guns. And the
      miserable aliens that escaped the guns were left to perish in the
      desolation of a coming winter which they were unfitted to withstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the first week of the season sped gaily, ending on Saturday with a
      heavy flight of northern woodcock and an uproarious fusillade among the
      silver birches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once Ferrall loaded two motor cars with pioneers for a day beyond his own
      boundaries; and one day was spent ingloriously with the beagles; but
      otherwise the Shotover estate proved more than sufficient for good bags or
      target practice, as the skill of the sportsmen developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Alderdene, good enough on snipe and cock, was driven almost frantic
      by the ruffed grouse; Voucher did better for a day or two, and then lost
      the knack; Marion Page attended to business in her cool and thorough
      style, and her average on the gun-room books was excellent, and was also
      adorned with clever pen-and-ink sketches by Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leroy Mortimer had given up shooting and established himself as a haunter
      of cushions in sunny corners. Tom O'Hara had gone back to Lenox; Mrs.
      Vendenning to Hot Springs. Beverly Plank, master of Black Fells, began to
      pervade the house after a tentative appearance; and he and Major Belwether
      pottered about the coverts, usually after luncheon&mdash;the latter doing
      little damage with his fowling-piece, and nobody knew how much with his
      gossiping tongue. Quarrier appeared in the field methodically, shot with
      judgment, taking no chances for a brilliant performance which might
      endanger his respectable average. As for the Page boys, they kept the
      river ducks stirring whenever Eileen Shannon and Rena Bonnesdel could be
      persuaded to share the canoes with them. Otherwise they haunted the
      vicinity of those bored maidens, suffering snubs sorrowfully, but
      persistently faithful. They were a great nuisance in the evening,
      especially as their sister did not permit them to lose more than ten
      dollars a day at cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cards&mdash;that is Bridge and Preference&mdash;ruled as usual; and the
      latter game being faster suited Mortimer and Ferrall, but did not aid
      Siward toward recouping his Bridge losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noticing this, late in the week, Major Belwether kindly suggested Klondyke
      for Siward's benefit, which proved more quickly disastrous to him than
      anything yet proposed; and he went back to Bridge, preferring rather to
      &ldquo;carry&rdquo; Agatha Caithness at intervals than crumble into bankruptcy under
      the sheer deadly hazard of Klondyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two matters occupied him; since &ldquo;cup day&rdquo; he had never had another
      opportunity to see Sylvia Landis alone; that was the first matter. He had
      touched neither wine nor spirits nor malt since the night Ferrall had
      found him prone, sprawling in a stupor on his disordered bed. That was the
      second matter, and it occupied him, at times required all his attention,
      particularly when the physical desire for it set in, steadily,
      mercilessly, mounting inexorably like a tide.... But, like the tide, it
      ebbed at last, particularly when a sleepless night had exhausted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had gone back to his shooting again after a cool review of the ethics
      involved. It even amused him to think that the whimsical sermon delivered
      him by a girl who had cleverness enough to marry many millions, with
      Quarrier thrown in, could have so moved him to sentimentality. He had
      ceded the big cup of antique silver to Quarrier, too&mdash;a matter which
      troubled him little, however, as in the irritation of the reaction he had
      been shooting with the brilliancy of a demon; and the gun-room books were
      open to any doubting guests' inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time, therefore, was never heavy on his hands, save when the tide
      threatened&mdash;when at night he stirred and awoke, conscious of its
      crawling advance, aware of its steady mounting menace. Moments at table,
      when the aroma of wine made him catch his breath, moments in the gun-room
      redolent of spicy spirits; a maddening volatile fragrance clinging to the
      card-room, too! Yes, the long days were filled with such moments for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But afield the desire faded; and even during the day, indoors, he shrugged
      desire aside. It was night that he dreaded&mdash;the long hours, lying
      there tense, stark-eyed, sickened with desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Sylvia, she and Grace Ferrall had taken to motoring, driving away
      into the interior or taking long flights north and south along the coast.
      Sometimes they took Quarrier, sometimes, when Mrs. Ferrall drove, they
      took in ballast in the shape of a superfluous Page boy and a girl for him.
      Once Grace Ferrall asked Siward to join them; but no definite time being
      set, he was scarcely surprised to find them gone when he returned from a
      morning on the snipe meadows. And Sylvia, leagues away by that time,
      curled up in the tonneau beside Grace Ferrall, watched the dark pines
      flying past, cheeks pink, eyes like stars, while the rushing wind drove
      health into her and care out of her&mdash;cleansing, purifying,
      overwhelming winds flowing through and through her, till her very soul
      within her seemed shining through the beauty of her eyes. Besides, she had
      just confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He kissed you!&rdquo; repeated Grace Ferrall incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;a number of times. He was silly enough to do it, and I let
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did&mdash;did he say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what he said; I was all nerves&mdash;confused&mdash;scared&mdash;a
      perfect stick in fact!... I don't believe he'd care to try again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mrs. Ferrall deliberately settled down in her furs to extract from
      the girl beside her every essential detail; and the girl, frank at first,
      grew shy and silent&mdash;reticent enough to worry her friend into a
      silence which lasted a long while for a cheerful little matron of her
      sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they spoke of other matters&mdash;matters interesting to pretty
      women with much to do in the coming winter between New York, Hot Springs,
      and Florida; surmises as to dinners, dances, and the newcomers in the
      younger sets, and the marriages to be arranged or disarranged, and the
      scandals humanity is heir to, and the attitude of the bishop toward
      divorce.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the new pavillion to be built for Saint Berold's Hospital, and the
      various states of the various charities each was interested in, and the
      chances of something new at the opera, and the impossibility of saving
      Fifth Avenue from truck traffic, and the increasing importance of
      Washington as a social centre, and the bad manners of a foreign
      ambassador, and the better manners of another diplomat, and the lack of
      discrimination betrayed by our ambassador to a certain great Power in
      choosing people for presentation at court, and the latest unhappy
      British-American marriage, and the hopelessness of the French as decent
      husbands, and the recent accident to the Claymores' big yacht, and the
      tendency of well-born young men toward politics, and the anything but
      distinguished person of Lord Alderdene, which was, however, vastly
      superior to the demeanour and person of others of his rank recently
      imported, and the beauty of Miss Caithness, and the chance that Captain
      Voucher had if Leila Mortimer would let him alone, and the absurdity of
      the Page twins, and the furtive coarseness of Leroy Mortimer and his
      general badness, and the sadness of Leila Mortimer's lot when she had
      always been in love with other people,&mdash;and a little scandalous
      surmise concerning Tom O'Hara, and the new house on Seventy-ninth Street
      building for Mrs. Vendenning, and that charming widow's success at last
      year's horse show&mdash;and whether the fashion of the function was
      reviving, and whether Beverly Plank had completely broken into the social
      sets he had besieged so long, or whether a few of the hunting and shooting
      people merely permitted him to drive pheasants for them, and why Katharyn
      Tassel made eyes at him, having sufficient money of her own to die unwed,
      and&mdash;and&mdash;and then, at last, as the big motor car swung in a
      circle at Wenniston Cross-Roads, and poked its brass and lacquer muzzle
      toward Shotover, the talk swung back to Siward once more&mdash;having
      travelled half the world over to find him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the sweetest fellow with his mother,&rdquo; sighed Grace; &ldquo;and that
      counts heavily with me. But there's trouble ahead for her&mdash;sorrow and
      trouble enough for them both, if he is a true Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heredity again!&rdquo; said Sylvia impatiently. &ldquo;Isn't he man enough to win
      out? I'll bet you he settles down, marries, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marries? Not he! How many girls do you suppose have believed that&mdash;were
      justified in believing he meant anything by his attractive manner and nice
      ways of telling you how much he liked you? He had a desperate affair with
      Mrs. Mortimer&mdash;innocent enough I fancy. He's had a dozen within three
      years; and in a week Rena Bonnesdel has come to making eyes at him, and
      Eileen gives him no end of chances which he doesn't see. As for Marion
      Page, the girl had been on the edge of loving him for years! You laugh?
      But you are wrong; she is in love with him now as much as she ever can be
      with anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes I do. Hadn't you suspected it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as Sylvia had suspected it she remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If any woman in this world could keep him to the mark, she could,&rdquo;
       continued Mrs. Ferrall. &ldquo;He's a perfect fool not to see how she cares for
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia said: &ldquo;He is indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a sensible match, if she cared to risk it, and if he would
      only ask her. But he won't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; ventured Sylvia, &ldquo;she'll ask him. She strikes me as that sort.
      I do not mean it unkindly&mdash;only Marion is so tailor-made and
      cigaretteful&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ferrall looked up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he propose to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it's the first time for him. He finds women only too willing to play
      with him as a rule, and he doesn't have to be definite. I wonder what he
      meant by being so definite with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he meant marriage,&rdquo; said Sylvia serenely; yet there was the
      slightest ring in her voice; and it amused Mrs. Ferrall to try her a
      little further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you think he really intended to commit himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; retorted Sylvia, turning red. &ldquo;Do you think he found me
      over-willing, as you say he finds others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were probably a new sensation for him,&rdquo; inferred Mrs. Ferrall
      musingly. &ldquo;You mustn't take him seriously, child&mdash;a man with his
      record. Besides, he has the same facility with a girl that he has with
      everything else he tries; his pen&mdash;you know how infernally clever he
      is; and he can make good verse, and write witty jingles, and he can carry
      home with him any opera and play it decently, too, with the proper
      harmonies. Anything he finds amusing he is clever with&mdash;dogs, horses,
      pen, brush, music, women&rdquo;&mdash;that was too malicious, for Sylvia had
      flushed up painfully, and Grace Ferrall dropped her gloved hand on the
      hand of the girl beside her: &ldquo;Child, child,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he is not that
      sort; no decent man ever is unless the girl is too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia, sitting up very straight in her furs, said: &ldquo;He found me anything
      but difficult&mdash;if that's what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't. Please don't be vexed, dear. I plague everybody when I see an
      opening. There's really only one thing that worries me about it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Sylvia without interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's that you might be tempted to care a little for him, which, being
      useless, might be unwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am... tempted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not seriously!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo; She turned in a sudden nervous impatience foreign to her.
      &ldquo;Howard Quarrier is too perfectly imperfect for me. I'm glad I've said it.
      The things he knows about and doesn't know have been a revelation in this
      last week with him. There is too much surface, too much exterior admirably
      fashioned. And inside is all clock-work. I've said it; I'm glad I have. He
      seemed different at Newport; he seemed nice at Lenox. The truth is, he's a
      horrid disappointment&mdash;and I'm bored to death at my brilliant
      prospects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The low whizzing hum of the motor filled a silence that produced
      considerable effect upon Grace Ferrall. And, after mastering her wits, she
      said in a subdued voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it's my meddling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it isn't. I asked your opinion, but I knew what I was going to
      do. Only, I did think him personally possible&mdash;which made the
      expediency, the mercenary view of it easier to contemplate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was becoming as frankly brutal as she knew how to be, which made the
      revolt the more ominous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't think you could endure him for an hour or two a day, Sylvia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not that,&rdquo; said the girl almost sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid of myself&mdash;call it inherited mischief if you like! If I
      let a man do to me what Mr. Siward did when I was only engaged to Howard,
      what might I do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not that sort!&rdquo; said Mrs. Ferrall bluntly. &ldquo;Don't be exotic,
      Sylvia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know&mdash;if I don't know? Most girls are kissed; I&mdash;well
      I didn't expect to be. But I was! I tell you, Grace, I don't know what I
      am or shall be. I'm unsafe; I know that much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's moral and honest to realize it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ferrall suavely; &ldquo;and in
      doing so you insure your own safety. Sylvia dear, I wish I hadn't meddled;
      I'm meddling some more I suppose when I say to you, don't give Howard his
      congÃ© for the present. It is a horridly common thing to dwell upon, but
      Howard is too materially important to be cut adrift on the impulse of the
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too clever not to. Consider the matter wisely, dispassionately,
      intelligently, dear; then if by April you simply can't stand it&mdash;talk
      the thing over with me again,&rdquo; she ended rather vaguely and wistfully; for
      it had been her heart's desire to wed Sylvia's beauty and Quarrier's
      fortune, and the suitability of the one for the other was apparent enough
      to make even sterner moralists wobbly in their creed. Quarrier, as a
      detail of modern human architecture, she supposed might fit in somewhere,
      and took that for granted in laying the corner stone for her fairy palace
      which Sylvia was to inhabit. And now!&mdash;oh, vexation!&mdash;the
      neglected but essentially constructive detail of human architecture had
      buckled, knocking the dream palace and its princess and its splendour
      about her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things never happen in real life,&rdquo; she observed plaintively; &ldquo;only
      romances have plots where things work out. But we people in real life, we
      just go on and on in a badly constructed, plotless sort of way with no
      villains, no interesting situations, no climaxes, no ensemble. No, we grow
      old and irritable and meaner and meaner; we lose our good looks and
      digestions, and we die in hopeless discord with the unity required in a
      dollar and a half novel by a master of modern fiction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But some among us amass fortunes,&rdquo; suggested Sylvia, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we don't live happy ever after. Nobody ever had enough money in real
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some fall in love,&rdquo; observed Sylvia, musing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they are not content, silly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Because nobody ever had enough love in real life,&rdquo; mocked Sylvia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have said it, child. That is the malady of the world, and nobody
      knows it until some pretty ninny like you babbles the truth. And that is
      why we care for those immortals in romance, those fortunate lovers who, in
      fable, are given and give enough of love; those magic shapes in verse and
      tale whose hearts are satisfied when the mad author of their being inks
      his last period and goes to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia laughed awhile, then, chin on wrist, sat musing there, muffled in
      her furs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for love, I think I should be moderate in the asking, in the giving. A
      little&mdash;to flavour routine&mdash;would be sufficient for me I fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know so much about it,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Ferrall ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am permitted to speculate, am I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Only speculate in sound investments, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you make a sound investment in love? Isn't it always sheerest
      speculation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is why simple matrimony is usually a safer speculation than
      love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;love isn't matrimony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Match that with its complementary platitude and you have the essence of
      modern fiction,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Ferrall. &ldquo;Love is a subject talked to
      death, which explains the present shortage in the market I suppose. You're
      not in love and you don't miss it. Why cultivate an artificial taste for
      it? If it ever comes naturally, you'll be astonished at your capacity for
      it, and the constant deterioration in quantity and quality of the visible
      supply. Goodness! my epigrams make me yawn&mdash;or is it age and the ill
      humour of the aged when the porridge spills over on the family cat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the cat, I suppose,&rdquo; asked Sylvia, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes you are&mdash;and you go tearing away, back up, fur on end, leaving
      me by the fire with no porridge and only the aroma of the singeing fur to
      comfort me.... Still there's one thing to comfort me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty-cats come back, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I suppose so.... Do you believe I could induce him to wear his hair
      any way except pompadour?... and, dear, his beard is so dreadfully silky.
      Isn't there anything he could take for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a razor I'm afraid. Those long, thick, soft, eyelashes of his are
      ominous. Eyes of that sort ruin a man for my taste. He might just as
      reasonably wear my hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he can't follow the fashions in eyes,&rdquo; laughed Sylvia. &ldquo;Oh, this is
      atrocious of us&mdash;it is simply horrible to sit here and say such
      things. I am cold-blooded enough as it is&mdash;material enough, mean,
      covetous, contemptible&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear!&rdquo; said Grace Ferrall mildly, &ldquo;you are not choosing a husband; you
      are choosing a career. To criticise his investments might be bad taste; to
      be able to extract what amusement you can out of Howard is a direct mercy
      from Heaven. Otherwise you'd go mad, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace! Do you wish me to marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the alternative, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, nothing&mdash;self-respect, dowdiness, and peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I can see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Stephen Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To marry? No. To enjoy, yes.... Grace, I have had such a good time with
      him; you don't know! He is such a boy&mdash;sometimes; and I&mdash;I
      believe that I am rather good for him.... Not that I'd ever again let him
      do that sort of thing.... Besides, his curiosity is quenched; I am the
      sort he supposed. Now he's found out he will be nice.... It's been days
      since I've had a talk with him. He tried to, but I wouldn't. Besides, the
      major has said nasty things about him when Howard was present; nothing
      definite, only hints, smiling silences, innuendoes on the verge of matters
      rather unfit; and I had nothing definite to refute. I could not even
      appear to understand or notice&mdash;it was all done in such a horridly
      vague way. But it only made me like him; and no doubt that actress he took
      to the Patroons is better company than he finds in nine places out of ten
      among his own sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Grace Ferrall slowly, &ldquo;if that is the way you feel, I don't see
      why you shouldn't play with Mr. Siward whenever you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I. I've been a perfect fool not to.... Howard hates him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a question! A woman knows such things. Then, you remember that
      caricature&mdash;so dreadfully like Howard? Howard has no sense of humour;
      he detests such things. It was the most dreadful thing that Mr. Siward
      could have done to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meddled again!&rdquo; groaned Grace. &ldquo;Doesn't Howard know that I did that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but nothing I can say alters his conviction that the likeness was
      intended. You know it was a likeness! And if Mr. Siward had not told me
      that it was not intended, I should never have believed it to be an
      accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a prolonged silence Sylvia said, overcarelessly: &ldquo;I don't quite
      understand Howard. With me anger lasts but a moment, and then I'm open to
      overtures for peace... I think Howard's anger lasts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does,&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;He was a muff as a boy&mdash;a prig with a prig's
      memory under all his shallow, showy surface. I'm frank with you; I never
      could take my cousin either respectfully or seriously, but I've known him
      to take his own anger so seriously that years after he has visited it upon
      those who had really wronged him. And he is equipped for retaliation if he
      chooses. That fortune of his reaches far.... Not that I think him capable
      of using such a power to satisfy a mere personal dislike. Howard has
      principles, loads of them. But&mdash;the weapon is there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true that Mr. Siward is interested in building electric roads?&rdquo;
       asked Sylvia curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, child. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I wondered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Mortimer said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I suppose he is. I'll ask Kemp if you like. Why? Isn't it all right
      to build them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. Howard is in it somehow. In fact Howard's company is behind
      Mr. Siward's, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace Ferrall turned and looked at the girl beside her, laughing outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Howard doesn't do mysterious financial things to nice young men
      because they draw impudent pictures of him running after his dog&mdash;or
      for any other reason. That, dear, is one of those skilfully developed
      portions of an artistic plot; and plots exist only in romance. So do
      villains; and besides, my cousin isn't one. Besides that, if Howard is in
      that thing, no doubt Kemp and I are too. So your nice young man is in very
      safe company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You draw such silly inferences,&rdquo; said Sylvia coolly; but there was a good
      deal of colour in her cheeks; and she knew it and pulled her big motor
      veil across her face, fastening it under her chin. All of which amused
      Grace Ferrall infinitely until the subtler significance of the girl's
      mental processes struck her, sobering her own thoughts. Sylvia, too, had
      grown serious in her preoccupation; and the partie-Ã -deux terminated a few
      minutes later in a duet of silence over the tea-cups in the gun-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather had turned warm and misty; one of those sudden sea-coast
      changes had greyed the blue in the sky, spreading a fine haze over land
      and water, effacing the crisp sparkle of the sea, dulling the westering
      sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later Sylvia, glancing over her shoulder, noticed that a
      fine misty drizzle had clouded the casements. That meant that her usual
      evening stroll on the cliffs with Quarrier, before dressing for dinner,
      was off. And she drew a little breath of unconscious relief as Marion Page
      walked in, her light woollen shooting-jacket, her hat, shoes, and the
      barrels of the fowling-piece tucked under her left arm-pit, all glimmering
      frostily with powdered rain drops.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said something to Grace Ferrall about the mist promising good
      point-shooting in the morning, took the order book from a servant, jotted
      down her request to be called an hour before sunrise, filled in the
      gun-room records with her score&mdash;the species and number bagged, and
      the number of shells used&mdash;and accepting the tea offered, drew out a
      tiny cigarette-case of sweet-bay wood heavily crusted with rose-gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With whom were you shooting?&rdquo; asked Grace, as Marion dropped one
      well-shaped leg over the other and wreathed her delicately tanned features
      in smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen Siward and Blinky. They're at it yet, but I had some letters to
      write.&rdquo; She glanced leisurely at Sylvia and touched the ash-tray with the
      whitening end of her cigarette. &ldquo;That dog you let Mr. Siward have is a
      good one. I'm taking him to Jersey next week for the cock-shooting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia returned her calm gaze blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unreasonable and disagreeable shock had passed through her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My North Carolina pointers are useless for close work,&rdquo; observed Marion
      indifferently; and she leaned back, watching the blue smoke curling upward
      from her cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia, distrait, but with downcast eyes on fire under the fringed lids,
      was thinking of the cheque Siward had given her for Sagamore. The
      transaction, for her, had been a business one on the surface only. She had
      never meant to use the cheque. She had laid it away among a few letters,
      relics, pleasant souvenirs of the summer. To her the affair had been
      softened by a delicate hint of intimacy,&mdash;the delight he was to take
      in something that had once been hers had given her a faint taste of the
      pleasure of according pleasure to a man. And this is what he had done!
    </p>
    <p>
      The drizzle had turned to fog, through which rain was now pelting the
      cliffs; people were returning from the open; a motor-car came whizzing
      into the drive, and out of it tumbled Rena and Eileen and the faithful
      Pages, the girls irritable and ready for tea, and the boys like a pair of
      eager, wagging, setter puppies, pleased with everything and everybody,
      utterly oblivious to the sombre repose brooding above the tea-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their sister calmly refused them the use of her cigarettes. Eileen
      presented her pretty shoulder, Rena nearly yawned at them, but, nothing
      dampened, they recounted a number of incidents with reciprocal enthusiasm
      to Sylvia, who was too inattentive to smile, and to Grace Ferrall, who
      smiled the more sweetly through sheer inattention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Alderdene came in, blinking a greeting through his foggy goggles,
      sloppy, baggy, heavy shoes wheezing, lingered in the vicinity long enough
      to swallow his &ldquo;peg&rdquo; and acquire a disdainful opinion of his shooting from
      Marion, and then took himself off, leaving the room noisy with his laugh,
      which resembled the rattle of a startled kingfisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ones and twos the guests reported as the dusk-curtained fog closed in
      on Shotover. Quarrier came, dry as a chip under his rain-coat, but his
      silky beard was wet with rain, and moisture powdered his long, soft
      eyelashes and white skin; and his flexible, pointed fingers, as he drew
      off his gloves, seemed startling in their whiteness through the gathering
      gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose our evening walk is out of the question,&rdquo; he said, standing by
      Sylvia, who had nodded a greeting and then turned her head rather hastily
      to see who had entered the room. It was Siward, only a vague shape in the
      gloom, but perfectly recognisable to her. At the same moment Marion Page
      rose leisurely and strolled toward the billiard-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our walk?&rdquo; repeated Sylvia absently&mdash;&ldquo;it's raining, you know.&rdquo; Yet
      only a day or two ago she had walked to church with Siward through the
      rain, the irritated Major feeling obliged to go with them. Her eyes
      followed Siward's figure, suddenly dark against the door of the lighted
      billiard-room, then brilliantly illuminated, as he entered, nodded
      acceptance to Mortimer's invitation, and picked up the cue just laid aside
      by Agatha Caithness, who had turned to speak to Marion. Then Mortimer's
      bulk loomed nearer; voices became gay and animated in the billiard-room.
      Siward's handsome face was bent toward Agatha Caithness in gay challenge;
      Mortimer's heavy laugh broke out; there came the rattle of pool-balls, and
      the dull sound of cue-butts striking the floor; then, crack! and the game
      began, with Marion Page and Siward fighting Mortimer and Miss Caithness
      for something or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier had been speaking for some time before Sylvia became aware of it&mdash;something
      about a brisk walk in the morning somewhere; and she nodded impatiently,
      watching Marion's supple waist-line as she bent far over the illuminated
      table for a complicated shot at the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fiancÃ©e's inattention was not agreeable to Quarrier. A dozen things
      had happened since his arrival which had not been agreeable to him: her
      failure to meet him at the Fells Crossing, and the reason for her failure;
      and her informal acquaintance with Siward, whose presence at Shotover he
      had not looked for, and her sudden intimacy with the man he had never
      particularly liked, and whom within six months he had come to detest and
      to avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things&mdash;the outrageous liberty Siward had permitted himself in
      caricaturing him, the mortifying caprice of Sylvia for Siward on the day
      of the Shotover cup-drive&mdash;had left indelible impressions in a cold
      and rather heavy mind, slow to waste effort in the indulgence of any vital
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few years indifference to Siward had changed to passive disapproval;
      that, again, to an emotionless dislike; and when the scandal at the
      Patroons Club occurred, for the first time in his life he understood what
      it was to fear the man he disliked. For if Siward had committed the insane
      imprudence which had cost him his title to membership, he had also done
      something, knowingly or otherwise, which awoke in Quarrier a cold, slow
      fear; and that fear was dormant, but present, now, and it, for the time
      being, dictated his attitude and bearing toward the man who might or might
      not be capable of using viciously a knowledge which Quarrier believed that
      he must possess.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that reason, when it was not possible to avoid Siward, his bearing
      toward him was carefully civil; for that reason he dampened Major
      Belwether's eagerness to tell everybody all he knew about the shamelessly
      imprudent girl who had figured with Siward in the scandal, but whose
      identity the press had not discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence was always desirable to Quarrier; silence concerning all matters
      was a trait inborn and congenially cultivated to a habit by him in every
      affair of life&mdash;in business, in leisure, in the methodical pursuits
      of such pleasures as a limited intellect permitted him, in personal and
      family matters, in public questions and financial problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened always, but never invited confidences; he had no opinion to
      express when invited. And he became very, very rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      And over it all spread a thin membrane of vanity, nervous, not
      intellectual, sensitiveness; for all sense of humour was absent in this
      man, whose smile, when not a physical effort, was automatically and
      methodically responsive to certain fixed cues. He smiled when he said
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; when declining or accepting invitations, when taking his
      leave, when meeting anybody of any financial importance, and when
      everybody except himself had begun to laugh in a theatre or a
      drawing-room. This limit to any personal manifestation he considered a
      generous one. And perhaps it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden rain-squall, noisy against the casements, had darkened the room;
      then the electric lights broke out with a mild candle-like lustre, and
      Quarrier, standing beside Sylvia's chair, discovered it to be empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until he had dressed for dinner that he saw her again, seated
      on the stairs with Marion Page&mdash;a new appearance of intimacy for both
      women, who heretofore had found nothing except a passing civility in
      common.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marion was discussing dog-breeding with that cool, crude, direct
      insouciance so unpleasant to some men. Sylvia was attentive, curious, and
      instinctively shrinking by turns, secretly dismayed at the overplainness
      of terms employed in kennel lore by the girl at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation veered toward the Sagamore pup. Marion explained that
      Siward was too busy to do any Southern shooting, which was why he was glad
      to have her polish Sagamore on Jersey woodcock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was not good for a dog to be used by anybody except his
      master,&rdquo; said Sylvia carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only second-raters suffer. Besides, I have shot enough, now, with Mr.
      Siward to use his dog as he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is an agreeable shooting companion, smiled Sylvia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is perfect,&rdquo; answered Marion coolly. &ldquo;The only test for a thoroughbred
      is the field. He rings true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They exchanged carefully impersonal views on Siward's good qualities for a
      moment or two; then Marion said bluntly: &ldquo;Do you know anything in
      particular about that Patroons Club affair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sylvia, &ldquo;nothing in particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I; and I don't care to; I mean, that I don't care what he did;
      and I wish that gossiping old Major would stop trying to hint it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I forgot. Beg your pardon, you know, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not offended,&rdquo; observed Sylvia, with a shrug of her pretty, bare
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marion laughed. &ldquo;Such a gadabout! Besides, I'm no prude, but he and Leroy
      Mortimer have no business to talk to unmarried women the way they do. No
      matter how worldly wise we are, men have no right to suppose we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; shrugged Sylvia. &ldquo;I have no patience to study out double-entendre,
      so it never shocks me. Besides&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was going to add that she was not at all versed in doubtful worldly
      wisdom, but decided not to, as it might seem to imply disapproval of
      Marion's learning. So she went on: &ldquo;Besides, what have innuendoes to do
      with Mr. Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know whether I care to understand them. The Major hinted that the
      woman&mdash;the one who figured in it&mdash;is&mdash;rather exclusively
      Mr. Siward's 'property.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exclusively?&rdquo; repeated Sylvia curiously. &ldquo;She's a public actress, isn't
      she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you call the manoeuvres of a newly fledged chorus girl acting, yes,
      she is. But I don't believe Mr. Siward figures in that unfashionable rÃ´le.
      Why, there are too many women of his own sort ready for mischief.&rdquo; Marion
      turned to Sylvia, her eyes hard with a cynicism quite lost on the other.
      &ldquo;That sort of thing might suit Leroy Mortimer, but it doesn't fit Mr.
      Siward,&rdquo; she concluded, rising as their hostess appeared from above and
      the butler from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all through dinner an indefinitely unpleasant remembrance of the
      conversation lingered with Sylvia, and she sat silent for minutes at a
      time, returning to actualities with a long, curious side-glance across at
      Siward, and an uncomprehending smile of assent for whatever Quarrier or
      Major Belwether had been saying to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cards she managed to avoid after dinner, and stood by Quarrier's chair for
      half an hour, absently watching the relentless method and steady adherence
      to rule which characterised his Bridge-playing, the eager, unslaked
      brutality of Mortimer, the set, selfish face of his pretty wife, the
      chilled intensity of Miss Caithness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Grace Ferrall's phrase recurred to her, &ldquo;Nobody ever has enough
      money!&rdquo;&mdash;not even these people, whose only worry was to find
      investment for the surplus they were unable to spend. Something of the
      meanness of it all penetrated her. Were these the real visages of these
      people, whose faces otherwise seemed so smooth and human? Was Leila
      Mortimer aware of the shrillness of her voice? Did Agatha Caithness
      realise how pinched her mouth and nose had grown? Did even Leroy Mortimer
      dream how swollen the pouches under his eyes were; how red and puffy his
      hands, shuffling a new pack; how pendulous and dreadful his red under-lip
      when absorbedly making up his cards?
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively she moved a step forward for a glimpse of Quarrier's face.
      The face appeared to be a study in blankness. His natural visage was
      emotionless and inexpressive enough, but this face, from which every
      vestige of colour had fled, fascinated her with its dead whiteness; and
      the hair brushed high, the long, black lashes, the silky beard, struck her
      as absolutely ghastly, as though they had been glued to a face of wax.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned on her heel, restless, depressed, inclined for companionship.
      The Page boys had tempted Rena and Eileen to the billiard-room; Voucher,
      Alderdene, and Major Belwether were huddled over a table, immersed in
      Preference; Katharyn Tassel and Grace Ferrall sat together looking over
      the announcements of Sylvia's engagement in a batch of New York papers
      just arrived; Ferrall was writing at a desk, and Siward and Marion were
      occupied in the former's sketch for an ideal shooting vehicle, to be built
      on the buckboard principle, with a clever arrangement for dogs, guns,
      ammunition, and provisions. Siward's profile, as it bent in the lamplight
      over the paper, was very engaging. The boyish note predominated as he
      talked while he drew, his eyes now smiling, now seriously intent on the
      sketch which was developing so swiftly under his facile pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marion's clean-cut blond head was close to his, her supple body twisted in
      her seat, one bare arm hanging over the back of the chair. Something in
      her attitude seemed to exclude intrusion; her voice, too, was hushed in
      comment, though his was pitched in his naturally agreeable key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia had taken a hesitating step toward them, but halted, turning
      irresolutely; and suddenly over her crept a sensation of isolation&mdash;something
      of that feeling which had roused her at midnight from her bed and driven
      her to Grace Ferrall for a refuge from she knew not what.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rustle of her silken dinner gown was scarcely perceptible as she
      turned. Siward, moving his head slightly, glanced up, then brought his
      sketch to a brilliant finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think something of this sort is practicable?&rdquo; he asked
      pleasantly, including Mrs. Ferrall and Katharyn Tassel in a general appeal
      which brought them into the circle of two. Grace Ferrall leaned forward,
      looking over Marion's shoulder, and Siward rose and stepped back, with a
      quick glance into the hall&mdash;in time to catch a glimmer of pale blue
      and lace on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose my cigarettes are in my room as usual,&rdquo; he said aloud to
      himself, wheeling so that he could not have time to see Marion's offer of
      her little gold-encrusted case, or notice her quickly raised eyes, bright
      with suspicion and vexation. For she, too, had observed Sylvia's distant
      entrance, had been perfectly aware of Siward's cognizance of Sylvia's
      retreat; and when Siward went on sketching she had been content. Now she
      could not tell whether he had deliberately and skillfully taken his congÃ©
      to follow Sylvia, or whether, in his quest for his cigarettes, chance
      might meddle, as usual. Even if he returned, she could not know with
      certainty how much of a part hazard had played on the landing above, where
      she already heard the distant sounds of Sylvia's voice mingling with
      Siward's, then a light footfall or two, and silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had greeted her in his usual careless, happy fashion, just as she had
      reached her chamber door; and she turned at the sound of his voice,
      confused, unsmiling, a little pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it headache, or are you too in quest of cigarettes?&rdquo; he asked, as he
      stopped in passing her where she stood, one slender hand on the knob of
      her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't smoke, you know,&rdquo; she said, looking up at him with a cool little
      laugh. &ldquo;It isn't headache either. I was&mdash;boring myself, Mr. Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any virtue in me as a remedy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have no doubt you have lots of virtues.... Perhaps you might do as
      a temporary remedy&mdash;first aid to the injured.&rdquo; She laughed again,
      uncertainly. &ldquo;But you are on a quest for cigarettes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rendezvous&mdash;with the Sand-Man.... Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night... if you must say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's polite to say something... isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be polite to say, 'With pleasure, Mr. Siward!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven't invited me to do anything&mdash;not even to accept a
      cigarette. Besides, you didn't expect to meet me up here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The trailing accent made it near enough a question for him to say, &ldquo;Yes, I
      did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you leave the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were sketching for Marion Page. Do you wish me to believe that you
      noticed me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;And followed you? Yes, I did follow you.&rdquo; She looked at him, then
      past him toward a corner of the wide hall where a maid in cap and apron
      sat pretending to be sewing. &ldquo;Careful!&rdquo; she motioned with smiling lips,
      &ldquo;servants gossip.... Good night, again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! you mustn't speak so loud,&rdquo; she motioned, with her fresh, sweet
      lips curving on the edge of that adorable smile once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't we have a moment&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minute&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! I must open my door&rdquo;&mdash;lingering. &ldquo;I might come out again, if
      you have anything particularly important to communicate to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have. There's a big bay-window at the end of the other corridor. Will
      you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she opened her door, with a light laugh, saying &ldquo;good night&rdquo; again,
      and closed it noiselessly behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked on, turning into his corridor, but kept straight ahead, passing
      his own door, on to the window at the end of the hall, then north along a
      wide passageway which terminated in a bay-window overlooking the roof of
      the indoor swimming tank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rain rattled heavily, against the panes and on the lighted roof of
      opalescent glass below, through which he could make out the shadowy fronds
      of palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that he had cigarettes enough, for he lighted one presently,
      and, leaving his chair, curled up in the cushioned and pillowed
      window-seat, gathering his knees together under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cigarette he had lighted went out. He had bitten into it and twisted
      it so roughly that it presently crumbled; and he threw the rags of it into
      a metal bowl, locking his jaws in silence. For the night threatened to be
      a bad one for him. A heavy fragrance from his neighbour's wine-glass at
      dinner had stirred up what had for a time lain dormant; and, by accident,
      something&mdash;some sweetmeat he had tasted&mdash;was saturated in
      brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, his restlessness at the prospect of a blank night had quickened to
      uneasiness, with a hint of fever tinting his skin, but, as yet, the dull
      ache in his body was scarcely more than a premonition.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had his own devices for tiding him over such periods&mdash;reading,
      tobacco, and the long, blind, dogged tramps he took in town. But here,
      to-night, in the rain, one stood every chance of walking off the cliffs;
      and he was sick of reading himself sightless over the sort of books sent
      wholesale to Shotover; and he was already too ill at ease, physically, to
      make smoking endurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were it not for a half-defiant, half-sullen dread of the coming night, he
      might have put it from his mind in spite of the slowly increasing nervous
      tension and the steady dull consciousness of desire. He drew another
      Sirdar from his case and sat staring at the rain-smeared night, twisting
      the frail fragrant cigarette to bits between his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while he began to walk monotonously to and fro the length of the
      corridor, like a man timing his steps to the heavy ache of body or mind.
      Once he went as far as his own door, entered, and stepping to the
      wash-basin, let the icy water run over hands and wrists. This sometimes
      helped to stimulate and soothe him; it did now, for a while&mdash;long
      enough to change the current of his thoughts to the girl he had hoped
      might have the imprudence to return for a tryst, innocent enough in
      itself, yet unconventional and unreasonable enough to prove attractive to
      them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably she wouldn't come; she had kept her fluffy skirts clear of him
      since Cup Day&mdash;which simply corroborated his vague estimate of her.
      Had she done the contrary, his estimate would have been the same; for,
      unconsciously but naturally, he had prejudged her. A girl who could
      capture Quarrier at full noontide, and in the face of all Manhattan, was a
      girl equipped for anything she dared&mdash;though she was probably too
      clever to dare too much; a girl to be interested in, to amuse and be
      amused by; a girl to be reckoned with. His restlessness and his fever
      subdued by the icy water, he stood drying his hands, thinking, coolly, how
      close he had come to being seriously in love with this young girl, whose
      attitude was always a curious temptation, whose smile was a charming
      provocation, whose youth and beauty were to him a perpetual challenge. He
      admitted to himself, calmly, that he had never seen a woman he cared as
      much for; that for the brief moment of his declaration he had known an
      utterly new emotion, which inevitably must have become the love he had so
      quietly declared it to be. He had never before felt as he felt then, cared
      as he cared then. Anything had been possible for him at that time&mdash;any
      degree of love, any devotion, any generous renunciation. Clear-sighted,
      master of himself, he saw love before him, and knew it when he saw it;
      recognised it, was ready for it, offered it, emboldened by her soft hands
      so eloquent in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in his arms he held it for an instant, he thought, spite of the sudden
      inertia, spite of the according of cold lips and hands still colder,
      relaxed, inert; held it until he doubted. That was all; he had been wise
      to doubt such sudden miracles as that. She, consummate and charming, had
      soon set him right. And, after all, she liked him; and she had been sure
      enough of herself to permit the impulse of a moment to carry her with him&mdash;a
      little way, a very little way&mdash;merely to the formal symbol of a
      passion the germ of which she recognised in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she had become intelligent again, with a little laughter, a little
      malice, a becoming tint of hesitation and confusion; all the sense, all
      the arts, all the friendly sweetness of a woman thorough in training,
      schooled in self-possession, clear enough to be audacious and perverse
      without danger to herself, to the man, or to the main chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing there alone in his lighted room, he wondered whether, had her
      trained and inbred policy been less precise, less worldly, she might have
      responded to such a man as he. Perfectly conscious that he had been
      capable of loving her; aware, too, that his experience had left him on
      that borderland only through his cool refusal to cross it and face a
      hopeless battle already lost, he leisurely and mentally took the measure
      of his own state of mind, and found all well, all intact; found himself
      still master of his affections, and probably clear-minded enough to remain
      so under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      To such a man as he, impulse to love, capacity to love, did not mean
      instant capsizing with a flop into sentimental tempests, where swamped,
      ardent and callow youth raises a hysterically selfish clamour for
      reciprocity or death. His nature partly, partly his character, accounted
      for this balance; and, in part, a rather wide experience with women of
      various degrees counted more.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, by instinct and experience, normally temperate, only what was abnormal
      and inherited might work a mischief in this man. His listlessness, his
      easy acquiescence, were but consequent upon the self-knowledge of
      self-control. But mastery of the master-vice required something different;
      he was sick of a sickness; and because, in this sickness, will, mind, and
      body are tainted too, reason and logic lack clarity; and, to the signals
      of danger his reply had always been either overconfident or weak&mdash;and
      it had been always the same reply: &ldquo;Not yet. There is time.&rdquo; And now, this
      last week, it had come upon him that the time was now; the skirmish was
      already on; and it had alarmed him suddenly to find that the skirmish was
      already a battle, and a rough one.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood there he heard voices on the stairs. People had already begun
      to retire, because late cards and point-shooting at dawn do not agree. And
      a point-shooting picnic in snugly elaborate blinds was popular with women&mdash;or
      was supposed to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could distinguish by their voices, by their laughter and step, the
      people who were mounting the stairway and lingering for gossip or passing
      through the various corridors to court the sleep denied him; he heard
      Mortimer's heavy tread and the soft shuffling step of Major Belwether as
      they left the elevator; and the patter of his hostess's satin slippers,
      and her gay &ldquo;good night&rdquo; on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little the tumult died away. Quarrier's measured step came,
      passed; Marion Page's cool, crisp voice and walk, and the giggle and amble
      of the twins, and Rena and Eileen,&mdash;the last laggards, with Ferrall's
      brisk, decisive tones and stride to close the procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and looked grimly at his bed, then, shutting off the lights, he
      opened his door and went out into the deserted corridor, where the
      elevator shaft was dark and only the dim night-lights burned at angles in
      the passageways.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had his rain-coat and cap with him, not being certain of what he might
      be driven to; but for the present he found the bay-window overlooking the
      swimming tank sufficient to begin the vigil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secure from intrusion, as there were no bedrooms on that corridor, he
      tossed coat and cap into the window-seat, walked to and fro for a while
      listening to the rain, then sat down, his well-shaped head between his
      hands. And in silence he faced the Enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long he had sat there he did not know. When he raised his face, all
      gray and drawn with the tension of conflict, his eyes were not very clear,
      nor did the figure standing there in the dim light from the hall mean
      anything for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Siward?&rdquo; in an uncertain voice, almost a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up mechanically, and she saw his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ill? What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill? No.&rdquo; He passed his hand over his eyes. &ldquo;I fancy I was close to the
      edge of sleep.&rdquo; Some colour came back into his face; he stood smiling now,
      the significance of her presence dawning on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you really come?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;This isn't a very lovely but impalpable
      astral vision, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's horridly imprudent, isn't it?&rdquo; she murmured, still considering the
      rather drawn and pallid face of the man before her. &ldquo;I came out of pure
      curiosity, Mr. Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced about her. He moved a big bunch of hothouse roses so she could
      pass, and she settled down lightly on the edge of the window-seat. When he
      had piled some big downy cushions behind her back, she made a quick
      gesture of invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only a moment,&rdquo; she said, as he seated himself beside her. &ldquo;Part
      of my curiosity is satisfied in finding you here; I didn't suppose you so
      faithful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can be fairly faithful. What else are you curious about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you had something important&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;To tell you? So I did. That was bribery, perjury, false pretences,
      robbery under arms, anything you will! I only wanted you to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a shameful confession!&rdquo; she said; but her smile was gay enough,
      and she noiselessly shook out her fluffy skirts and settled herself a
      trifle more deeply among the pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she observed absently, &ldquo;you are dreadfully mortified at
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patter of the rain attracted her attention; she peered out through the
      blurred casements into the blackness. Then, picking up his cap and
      indicating his raincoat, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;in case you hadn't come&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A walk? By yourself? A night like this on the cliffs! You are not
      perfectly mad, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face grew serious and beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, Mr. Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you care to be more explicit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, with a humourous glance at her, &ldquo;I haven't seen you for
      ages. That's not wholesome for me, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you see me now; and it does not seem to benefit you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel much better,&rdquo; he insisted, laughing; and her blue eyes grew very
      lovely as the smile broke from them in uncertain response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you had nothing really important to tell me, Mr. Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that I wanted you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!... I said important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he did not argue the question; and she leaned forward, broke a rose
      from its stem, then sank back a little way among the cushions, looking at
      him, idly inhaling the hothouse perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you so ostentatiously avoided me, Mr. Siward?&rdquo; she asked
      languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, upon my word!&rdquo; he said, with a touch of irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are so dreadfully literal!&rdquo; she shrugged, brushing her straight,
      sensitive nose with the pink blossom; &ldquo;I only said it to give you a
      chance.... If you are going to be stupid, good night!&rdquo; But she made no
      movement to go.... &ldquo;Yes, then; I have avoided you. And it doesn't become
      you to ask why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I kissed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hint at the true reason so chivalrously, so delicately,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;that I scarcely recognise it.&rdquo; The cool mockery of her voice and the
      warm, quick colour tinting neck and face were incongruous. He thought with
      slow surprise that she was not yet letter-perfect in her rÃ´le of the
      material triumphant over the spiritual. A trifle ashamed, too, he sat
      silent, watching the silken petals fall one by one as she slowly detached
      them with delicate, restless lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry I came,&rdquo; she said reflectively. &ldquo;You don't know why I came, do
      you? Sheer loneliness, Mr. Siward; there is something of the child in me
      still, you see. I am not yet sufficiently resourceful to take it out in a
      quietly tearful obligato; I never learned how to produce tears.... So I
      came to you.&rdquo; She had stripped the petals from the rose, and now, tossing
      the crushed branch from her, she leaned forward and broke from its stem a
      heavy, perfumed bud, half unfolded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems my fate to pass my life in bidding you good night,&rdquo; she said,
      straightening up and turning to him with the careless laughter touching
      mouth and eyes again. Then, resting her weight on one hand, her smooth,
      white shoulder rounded beside her cheek, she looked at him out of
      humourous eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that women find so attractive in you? The man's experienced
      insouciance? The boy's unconscious cynicism? The mystery of your
      self-sufficiency? The faulty humanity in you? The youth in you already
      showing traces of wear that hint of future scars? What will you be at
      thirty-five? At forty?... Ah,&rdquo; she added softly, &ldquo;what are you now? For I
      don't know, and you cannot tell me if you would.... Out of these little
      windows called eyes we look at one another, and study surfaces, and try to
      peep into neighbours' windows. But all is dark behind the windows&mdash;always
      dark, in there where they tell us souls hide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid the shell-pink bud against her cheek that matched it, smiling
      with wise sweetness to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What counts with you?&rdquo; he asked after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Counts? How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your affections. What prepossesses you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed audaciously: &ldquo;Your traits&mdash;some of them&mdash;all of them
      that you reveal. You must be aware of that much already, considering
      everything&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, what is it I lack? Where do I fail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't lack&mdash;you don't fail! I ask nothing more of you, Mr.
      Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man from whom a woman desires nothing is already convicted of
      insufficiency.... You would recognise this very quickly if I made love to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the only way I am to discover your insufficiency, Mr. Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or my sufficiency.... Have you enough curiosity to try?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I thought you were to try.&rdquo; Then, quickly: &ldquo;But I think you have
      already experimented; and I did not notice your shortcomings. So there is
      no use in pursuing that line of investigation any farther&mdash;is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And always with her the mischief lay in the trailing upward inflection; in
      the confused sweetness of her eyes, and their lovely uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      One slim white hand held the rose against her cheek; the other lay idly on
      her knee, fresh and delicate as a fallen petal; and he laid both hands
      over it and lifted it between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Siward, I am afraid this is becoming a habit with you.&rdquo; The gay
      mockery was not quite genuine; the curve of lips too sensitive for a voice
      so lightly cynical.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, bending there, considering her hand between his; and after a
      moment her muscles relaxed, and bare round arm and hand lay abandoned to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite flawless&mdash;perfect,&rdquo; he said aloud to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you&mdash;read hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vaguely.&rdquo; He touched the smooth palm: &ldquo;Long life, clear mind, and&rdquo;&mdash;he
      laughed&mdash;&ldquo;heart supreme over reason! There is written a white lie&mdash;but
      a pretty one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again, unconvinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the truth,&rdquo; she said, seriously insisting and bending sideways
      above her own hand where it lay in his. &ldquo;It is a miserable confession to
      admit it, but I'm afraid intelligence would fight a losing battle with
      heart if the conflict ever came. You see, I know, having nobody to study
      except myself all these years.... There is the proof of it&mdash;that
      selfish, smooth contour, where there should be generosity. Then, look at
      the tendency of imagination toward mischief!&rdquo; She laid her right
      forefinger on the palm of the left hand which he held, and traced the
      developments arising in the Mount of Hermes. &ldquo;Is it not a horrid hand, Mr.
      Siward? I don't know how much you know about palms, but&mdash;&rdquo; She
      suddenly flushed, and attempted to close her hand, doubling the thumb
      over. There was a little half-hearted struggle, freeing one of his arms,
      which fell, settling about her slender waist; a silence, a breathless
      moment, and he had kissed her. Her lips were warm, this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recovered herself, avoiding his eyes, and moved backward, shielding
      her face with pretty upflung elbows out-turned. &ldquo;I told you it was
      becoming a habit with you!&rdquo; The loud beating of her pulses marred her
      voice. &ldquo;Must I establish a dead-line every time I commit the folly of
      being alone with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll draw that line,&rdquo; he said, taking her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I beg you will draw it quickly, Mr. Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do; it passes through your heart and mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;do you mean a declaration&mdash;again? You are compromising
      yourself, you know. I warn you that you are committing yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So are you. Look at me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his arms, her own arms pressed against his breast, resisting, she
      raised her splendid youthful eyes; and through and through her shot pulse
      on pulse, until every nerve seemed aquiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While I'm still sane,&rdquo; he said with a dry catch in his throat, &ldquo;before I
      tell you that I love you, look at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, if you wish,&rdquo; she said with a trembling smile, &ldquo;but it is useless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I shall find out in time.... You must meet my eyes. That is
      well; that is frank and sweet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And useless&mdash;truly it is.... Please don't tell me&mdash;anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not listen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no chance for you&mdash;if you mean love. I&mdash;I tell you in
      time, you see.... I am utterly frivolous&mdash;quite selfish and
      mercenary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take my chance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I give you none! Why do you interfere! A&mdash;a girl's policy costs
      her something if it be worth anything; whatever it costs it is worth it to
      me.... And I do not love you. In so short a time how could I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then in his arms she fell a-trembling. Something blinded her eyes, and she
      turned her head sharply, only to encounter his lips on hers in a deep,
      clinging embrace that left her dazed, still resisting with the fragments
      of breath and voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not again&mdash;I beg&mdash;you. Let me go now. It is not best. Oh!
      truly, truly it is all wrong with us now.&rdquo; She bent her head, blinded with
      tears, swaying, stunned; then, with a breathless sound, turned in his arms
      to meet his lips, her hands contracting in his; and, confronting, they
      paused, suspending the crisis, young faces close, and hearts afire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvia, I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant their lips clung; she had rendered him his kiss. Then,
      tremblingly, &ldquo;It is useless... even though I loved you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I cannot!... And it is no use&mdash;no use! I do not know myself&mdash;this
      way. My eyes&mdash;are wet. It is not like me; there is nothing of me in
      this girl you hold so closely, so confidently.... I do care for you&mdash;how
      can I help it? How could any woman help it? Is not that enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until you are a bride, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bride? Stephen!&mdash;I cannot&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot help it, Sylvia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must! I have my way to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My way lies that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! no! I cannot do it; it is not best for me&mdash;not best for you....
      I do care for you; you have taught me how to say it. But&mdash;you know
      what I have done&mdash;and mean to do, and must carry through. Then, how
      can you love a girl like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, I know the woman I love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly, she is what her life has made her&mdash;material, passionately
      selfish, unable to renounce the root of all evil.... Even if this&mdash;this
      happiness were ours always&mdash;I mean, if this madness could last our
      wedded life&mdash;I am not good enough, not noble enough, to forget what I
      might have had, and put away.... Is it not dreadful to admit it? Do you
      not know that self-contempt is part of the price?... I have no money. I
      know what you have.... I asked. And it is enough for a man who remains
      unmarried.... For I cannot 'make things do'; I cannot 'contrive'; I will
      not cling to the fringe of things, or play that heartbreaking rÃ´le of the
      shabby expatriated on the Continent.... No person in this world ever had
      enough. I tell you I could find use for every flake of metal ever
      mined!... You see you do not know me. From my pretty face and figure you
      misjudge me. I am intelligent&mdash;not intellectual, though I might have
      been, might even be yet. I am cultivated, not learned; though I care for
      learning&mdash;or might, if I had time.... My rÃ´le in life is to mount to
      a security too high for any question as to my dominance.... Can you take
      me there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are other heights, Sylvia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Higher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spiritual; I know. I could not breathe there, if I cared to climb.
      ...And I have told you what I am&mdash;all silk and lace and
      smooth-skinned selfishness.&rdquo; She looked at him wistfully. &ldquo;If you can
      change me, take me.&rdquo; And she rose, facing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not give you up,&rdquo; he said, with a savage note hardening his voice;
      and it thrilled her to hear it, and every drop of blood in her body leaped
      as she yielded to his arms again, heavy-lidded, trembling, confused, under
      the piercing sweetness of contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perfume of her mouth, her hair, the consenting fingers locked in his,
      palm against palm, the lips, acquiescent, then afire at last, responsive
      to his own; and her eyes opening from the dream under the white lids&mdash;these
      were what he had of her till every vein in him pulsed flame. Then her
      voice, broken, breathless:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night. Love me while you can&mdash;and forgive me!... Good night....
      Where are we? All&mdash;all this must have stunned me, blinded me.... Is
      this my door, or yours? Hush! I am half dead with fear&mdash;to be here
      under the light again.... If you take me again, my knees will give way....
      And I must find my door. Oh, the ghastly imprudence of it!... Good
      night... good night. I&mdash;I love you!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI MODUS VIVENDI
    </h2>
    <p>
      After the first few days of his arrival at Shotover time had threatened to
      hang heavily on Mortimer's mottled hands. After the second day afield he
      recognised that his shooting career was practically over; he had become
      too bulky during the last year to endure the physical exertion; his
      habits, too, had at length made traitors of his eyes; a half hour's
      snipe-shooting in the sun, and the veins in his neck swelled ominously.
      Panting, eyes inflamed, fat arms wobbly, he had scored miss after miss,
      and laboured onward, sullenly persistent to the end. But it was the end.
      That cup day finished him; he recognised that he was done for. And,
      following the Law of Pleasure, which finishes us before we are finished
      with it, he did not experience any particular sense of deprivation in the
      prospect. Only the wholesome dread caging. But Mortimer, not yet done with
      self-indulgence in more convenient forms, cast about him within his new
      limits for occupation between those hours consecrated to the rites of the
      table and the card-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove four, but found that it numbed his arms, and that the sea air
      made him sleepy. Motor-cars agreed with him only when driving with a
      pretty woman. Forced through ennui to fish off the rocks, he soon tired of
      the sea-perch and rock-cod and the malodours of periwinkle and clam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he frankly took to Major Belwether's sunny side of the gun-room, with
      illustrated papers and apples and decanter. But Major Belwether, always as
      careful of his digestion as of his financial secrets, blandly dodged the
      pressing invitations to rum and confidence, until Mortimer sulkily took up
      his headquarters in the reading-room, on the chance of his wife's moving
      elsewhere. Which she did, unobtrusively carrying Captain Voucher with her
      in a sudden zeal for billiard practice on rainy mornings now too frequent
      along the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer possessed that mysterious talent, so common among the financially
      insolvent, for living lavishly on an invisible income. But, plan as he
      would, he had never been able to increase that income through confidential
      gossip with men like Quarrier or Belwether, or even Ferrall. What
      information his pretty wife might have extracted he did not know; her
      income had never visibly increased above the vanishing point, although,
      like himself, she denied herself nothing. One short, lively interview with
      her had been enough to drive all partnership ideas out of his head. If he
      wanted to learn anything financially advantageous to himself he must do it
      without her aid; and as he was perpetually in hopes of the friendly hint
      that never came, he still moused about when opportunity offered; and this
      also helped to kill time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, he was always studying women. Years before, Grace Ferrall had
      snapped her slim fingers in his face; and here, at Shotover, the field was
      limited. Mrs. Vendenning had left; Agatha Caithness was still a pale and
      reticent puzzle; Rena, Katharyn, and Eileen tormented him; Marion Page,
      coolly au fait, yawned in his face. There remained Sylvia, who, knowing
      nothing about his species, met him half-way with the sweet and sensitive
      deference due a somewhat battered and infirm gentleman of forty-eight&mdash;until
      a sleek aside from Major Belwether spoiled everything, as usual, for her,
      leaving her painfully conscious and perplexed between doubt and disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the wealthy master of Black Fells, Beverly Plank, had found
      encouragement enough at Shotover to venture on tentative informality.
      There was no doubt that ultimately he must be counted on in New York; but
      nobody except him was impatiently cordial for the event; and so, at the
      little house party, he slipped and slid from every attempt at closer
      quarters, until, rolling smoothly enough, he landed without much
      discomfort somewhere between Mr. and Mrs. Leroy Mortimer. And it was not a
      question as to &ldquo;which would be good to him,&rdquo; observed Major Belwether,
      with his misleading and benevolent mirth; &ldquo;it was, which would be goodest
      quickest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Mortimer, abandoning Captain Voucher by the same token, displayed
      certain warning notices perfectly comprehensive to her husband. And at
      first he was inclined to recognise defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the general insuccess which had so faithfully attended him recently
      had aroused the long-dormant desire for a general review of the situation
      with his wife&mdash;perhaps even the furtive hope of some conjugal
      arrangement tending toward an exchange of views concerning possible
      alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening previous, to his intense disgust, host, hostess, and guests
      had retired early, in view of the point-shooting at dawn. For not only was
      there to be no point-shooting for him, but he had risen from the
      card-table heavily hit; and besides, for the first time his apples and
      port had disagreed with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he had not risen until mid-day he was not sleepy. Books were an
      aversion equalled only by distaste for his own company. Irritated, bored,
      he had perforce sulkily entered the elevator and passed to his room, where
      there was nothing on earth for him to do except to thumb over last week's
      sporting periodicals and smoke himself stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it required more than that to ensnare the goddess of slumber. He
      walked about the room, haunted of slow thoughts; he stood at the
      rain-smeared pane, fat fingers resting on the glass. The richly flavoured
      cigar grew distasteful; and if he could not smoke, what, in pity's name,
      was he to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily his distended eyes wandered to his wife's locked and bolted
      door; then he thought of Beverly Plank, and his own failure to fasten
      himself upon that anxiously over-cordial individual with his houses and
      his villas and his yachts and his investments!
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped to the switch and extinguished the lights in his room. Under
      the door, along the sill, a glimmer came from his wife's bed-chamber. He
      listened; the maid was still there; so he sat down in the darkness to
      wait; and by-and-by he heard the outer bedroom door close, and the subdued
      rustle of the departing maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning on his lights, he moved ponderously and jauntily to his
      wife's door and knocked discreetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leila Mortimer came to the door and opened it; her hair was coiled for the
      night, her pretty figure outlined under a cascade of clinging lace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; she asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you point-shooting to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to chat with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry. I'm driving to Wenniston, after breakfast, with Beverly Plank,
      and I need sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to talk to you,&rdquo; he repeated doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She regarded him for a moment in silence, then, with an assenting gesture,
      turned away into her room; and he followed, heavily apprehensive but
      resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had seated herself among a pile of cushions, one knee crossed over the
      other, her slim white foot half concealed by the silken toe of her
      slipper. And as he pulled a chair forward for himself, her pretty black
      eyes, which slanted a little, took his measure and divined trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leila,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why can't we have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cigarette?&rdquo; she interrupted, indicating her dainty case on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took one, savagely aware of defiance somewhere. She lighted her own
      from a candle and settled back, studying the sequence of blue smoke-rings
      jetting upward to the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About this man Plank,&rdquo; he began, louder than he had intended through
      sheer self-mistrust; and his wife made a quick, disdainful sign of
      caution, which subdued his voice instantly. &ldquo;Why can't we take him up&mdash;together,
      Leila?&rdquo; he ended lamely, furious at his own uneasiness in a matter which
      might concern him vitally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see no necessity of your taking him up,&rdquo; observed his wife serenely. &ldquo;I
      can do what may be useful to him in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So can I. There are clubs where he ought to be seen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can manage such matters much better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't manage everything,&rdquo; he insisted sullenly. &ldquo;There are chances of
      various sorts&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Investments?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Mortimer, with bright malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Leila, you have your own way too much. I say little; I make
      damned few observations; but I could, if I cared to.... It becomes you to
      be civil at least. I want to talk over this Plank matter with you; I want
      you to listen, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shade of faint disgust passed over her face. &ldquo;I am listening,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I can see several ways in which the man can be of use to
      me.... I discovered him before you did, anyway. And what I want to do is
      to have a frank, honourable&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;An honourable understanding with you, I said,&rdquo; he repeated,
      reddening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; She snapped her cigarette into the grate. &ldquo;Oh! I see. And what
      then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you and I can arrange to stand behind him this winter in town, can't
      we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;damn it!&mdash;the beggar can show his gratitude, can't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; she asked listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By making good. How else?&rdquo; he retorted savagely. &ldquo;He can't welch because
      there's little to climb for beyond us; and even if he climbs, he can't
      ignore us. I can do as many things for him in my way as you can in yours.
      What is the use of being a pig, Leila? Anything he does for me isn't going
      to cancel his obligations to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him better than you do,&rdquo; she observed, bending her head and
      pleating the lace on her knee. &ldquo;There is Dutch blood in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not good Hollander, but common Dutch,&rdquo; sneered Mortimer. &ldquo;And you mean
      he'll squeeze a dollar till the eagle screams-don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat silent, pleating her lace with steady fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's all right, too,&rdquo; laughed Mortimer easily; &ldquo;let the Audubon
      Society worry over the eagle. It's a perfectly plain business proposition;
      we can do for him in a couple of winters what he can't do for himself in
      ten. Figure it out for yourself, Leila,&rdquo; he said, waving a mottled fat
      hand at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;have,&rdquo; she said under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, is it settled?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Settled&mdash;how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we form ourselves into a benevolent society of two in behalf of
      Plank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don't want to, Roy,&rdquo; she said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not say why not, seated there nervously pleating the fragile stuff
      clinging to her knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he repeated menacingly. Her unexpectedly quiescent attitude had
      emboldened him to a bullying tone&mdash;something he had not lately
      ventured on.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes to his: &ldquo;I&mdash;rather like him,&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, by God! he'll pay for that!&rdquo; he burst out, mask off, every inflamed
      feature shockingly congested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roy! You dare not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dare not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The palpitating silence lengthened; slowly the blood left the swollen
      veins. Heavy pendulous lip hanging, he stared at her from distended eyes,
      realising that he had forgotten himself. She was right. He dared not. And
      she held the whip-hand as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      For every suspicion he could entertain, she had evidence of a certainty to
      match it; for every chance that he might have to prove anything, she had
      twenty proven facts. And he knew it. Why they had, during all these years,
      made any outward pretence of conjugal unity they alone knew. The modus
      vivendi suited them better than divorce: that was apparent, or had been
      until recently. Recently Leila Mortimer had changed&mdash;become subdued
      and softened to a degree that had perplexed her husband. Her attitude
      toward him lacked a little of the bitterness and contempt she usually
      reserved for him in private; she had become more prudent, almost cautious
      at times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you one thing,&rdquo; he said with a sudden snarl: &ldquo;You'd better be
      careful there is no gossip about you and Plank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reddened under the insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we'll see,&rdquo; he continued venomously, &ldquo;how far you can go alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose,&rdquo; she asked calmly, &ldquo;that I am afraid of a divorce court?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question so frankly astonished him that he sat agape, unable to reply.
      For years he had very naturally supposed her to be afraid of it&mdash;afraid
      of not being qualified to obtain it. Indeed, he had taken that for granted
      as the very corner-stone of their mutual toleration. Had he been an ass to
      do so? A vague alarm took possession of him; for, with that understanding,
      he had not been at all careful of his own behaviour, neither had he been
      at any particular pains to conceal his doings from her. His alarm
      increased. What had he against her, after all, except ancient suspicions,
      now so confused and indefinite that memory itself outlawed the case, if it
      ever really existed. What had she against him? Facts&mdash;unless she was
      more stupid than any of her sex he had ever encountered. And now, this
      defiance, this increasing prudence, this subtle change in her, began to
      make him anxious for the permanency of the small income she had allowed
      him during all these years&mdash;doled out to him, as he believed, though
      her dormant fear of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; he said harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I mentioned divorce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, cut it out! D'ye see? Cut it, I say. You'd stand as much chance
      before a referee as a snowball in hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no telling,&rdquo; she said coolly, &ldquo;until one tries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glared at her, then burst into a laugh. &ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; he said thickly. &ldquo;Talk
      sense, Leila! And keep this hard-headed Dutchman for yourself, if you feel
      that way about it. I don't want to butt in. I only thought&mdash;for old
      times' sake&mdash;perhaps you'd&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; she managed to say, her disgust almost strangling her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he went, furtively, heavy-footed, perplexed, inwardly cursing his
      blunder in stirring up a sleeping lioness whom he had so long mistaken for
      a dozing cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      For hours he sat in his room, or paced the four walls, doubtful,
      chagrined, furious by turns. Once he drew out a memorandum-book and stood
      under a lighted sconce, studying the figures. His losses at Shotover
      staggered him, but he had looked to his wife heretofore in such
      emergencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly the time had come for him to do something. But what?&mdash;if
      his wife was going to strike such attitudes in the very face of decency?
      Certainly a husband in these days was without honour in his own household.
    </p>
    <p>
      His uneasiness had produced a raging thirst. He punched an electric button
      with his fleshy thumb, and prowled around, waiting. Nobody came; he
      punched again, and looked at his watch. It astonished him to find the hour
      was three o'clock in the morning. That discovery, however, only appeared
      to increase his thirst. He opened the hall door, prepared to descend into
      the depths of the house and raid a sideboard; and as he thrust his heavy
      head out into the lighted corridor his eyes fell upon two figures standing
      at the open door of a bedroom. One was Siward; that was plain. Who was the
      girl he had kissed? One of the maids? Somebody's wife? Who?
    </p>
    <p>
      Every dull pulse began to hammer in Mortimer's head. In his excitement he
      stepped half-way into the corridor, then skipped nimbly back, closing his
      door without a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvia Landis, by all that's holy!&rdquo; he breathed to himself, and sat down
      rather suddenly on the edge of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while he rose and crept to the door, opened it, glued his eyes to
      the crack, in time to catch a glimpse of Siward entering his own corridor
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that night, Mortimer, lying awake in bed, busy with schemes, became
      conscious of a definite idea. It took shape and matured so suddenly that
      it actually shocked his moral sense. Then it scared him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but that is blackmail!&rdquo; he whispered aloud. &ldquo;A man can't do
      that sort of thing. What the devil ever put it into my head?... And there
      are men I know&mdash;women, too&mdash;scoundrelly blackguards, who'd use
      that information somehow; and make it pay, too. The scoundrels!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He squirmed down among the bedclothes with a sudden shiver; but the night
      had turned warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scoundrels!&rdquo; he said, with milder emphasis. &ldquo;Blackmailers! Contemptible
      pups!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fell asleep an hour later, muttering something incoherent about
      scoundrels and blackmail.
    </p>
    <p>
      And meanwhile, in the darkened house, from all round came the noise of
      knocking on doors, sounds of people stirring&mdash;a low voice here and
      there, lights breaking out from transoms, the thud of rubber-shod heels,
      the rattle of cartridges from the echoing gun-room. For the guests at
      Shotover were awaking, lest the wet sky, whitening behind the east, ring
      with the whimpering wedges of wild-fowl rushing seaward over empty blinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unusual stillness of the house in the late morning sunshine was
      pleasant to Miss Landis. She had risen very late, unconscious of the stir
      and movement before dawn; and it was only when a maid told her, as she
      came from her bath, that she remembered the projected point-shooting, and
      concluded, with an odd, happy sense of relief, that she was almost alone
      in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later, glancing from her bedroom window for a fulfilment of the
      promise of the sun which a glimpse of blue sky heralded, she saw Leila
      Mortimer settling herself in the forward seat of a Mercedes, and Beverly
      Plank climbing in beside her; and she watched Plank steer the big machine
      across the wet lawn, while the machinist swung himself into the tonneau;
      and away they rolled, faster, faster, rushing out into the misty
      hinterland, where the long streak of distant forest already began to
      brighten, edged with the first rays of watery sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she had the big house to herself&mdash;every bit of it and with it
      freedom from obligation, from comment, from demand or exaction; freedom
      from restraint; liberty to roam about, to read, to dream, to idle, to
      remember! Ah, that was what she needed&mdash;a quiet interval in this
      hurrying youth of hers to catch her breath once more, and stand still, and
      look back a day or two and remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, to breakfast all alone was delicious; to stroll, unhurried, to the
      sideboard and leisurely choose among the fresh cool fruits; to loiter over
      cream-jug and cereal; to saunter out into the freshness of the world and
      breathe it, and feel the sun warming cheek and throat, and the little
      breezes from a sunlit sea stirring the bright strands of her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the increasing brilliancy of the sunshine she stretched out her hands,
      warming them daintily as she might twist them before the fire on the
      hearth. And here, at the fragrant hearth of the world, she stood, sweet
      and fresh as the morning itself, untroubled gaze intensely blue with the
      tint of the purple sea, sensitive lips scarcely parting in the dreaming
      smile that made her eyes more wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the warmth grew on land and water, penetrating her body, a faintly
      delicious glow responded in her heart,&mdash;nothing at first wistful in
      the serene sense of well-being, stretching her rounded arms skyward in the
      unaccustomed luxury of a liberty which had become the naively unconscious
      licence of a child. The poise of sheer health stretched her to tiptoe;
      then the graceful tension relaxed, and her smooth fingers uncurled,
      tightened, and fell limp as her arms fell and her superb young figure
      straightened, confronting the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out over the rain-wet, odorous grass she picked her way, skirts swung high
      above the delicate contour of ankle and limb, following a little
      descending path she knew full of rocky angles, swept by pendant sprays of
      blackberry, and then down under the jutting rock, south through thickets
      of wild cherry along the crags, until, before her the way opened downward
      again where a tiny crescent beach glimmered white hot in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his bedroom window Mortimer peeped forth, following her progress with
      a leer.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she descended, noticing the rifts of bronzing seaweed piled along the
      tide mark, her foot dislodged a tiny triangle of rock, which rolled
      clattering and ringing below; and as she sprang lightly to the sand, a
      man, lying full length and motionless as the heaped seaweed, raised
      himself on one arm, turning his sun-dazzled eyes on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dull shock of surprise halted her as Siward rose to his feet, still
      dazed, the sand running from his brown shooting-clothes over his tightly
      strapped puttees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you the faintest idea that I supposed you were here?&rdquo; she asked
      briefly. Then, frank in her disappointment, she looked up at the cliffs
      overhead, where her line of retreat lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not go with the others?&rdquo; she added, unsmiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;don't know. I will, if you wish.&rdquo; He had coloured slowly, the
      frank disappointment in her face penetrating his surprise; and now he
      turned around, instinctively, also looking for the path of retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she said, aware of her own crude attitude and confused by it;
      &ldquo;wait a moment, Mr. Siward. I don't mean to drive you away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's self-exile,&rdquo; he said quietly; &ldquo;quite voluntary, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Siward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, as he looked up coolly, &ldquo;Have you nothing more friendly to say to me?
      Is your friendship for me so limited that my first caprice oversteps the
      bounds? Must I always be in dread of wounding you when I give you the
      privilege of knowing me better than anybody ever knew me&mdash;of seeing
      me as I am, with all my faults, my failings, my impulses, my real self?
      ...I don't know why the pleasure of being alone to-day should have meant
      exclusion for you, too. It was the unwelcome shock of seeing anybody&mdash;a
      selfish enjoyment of myself&mdash;that surprised me into rudeness. That is
      all.... Can you not understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so. I meant no criticism&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, Mr. Siward!&rdquo; as he moved slowly toward the path. &ldquo;You force me to
      say other things, which you have no right to hear.... After last night&rdquo;&mdash;the
      vivid tint grew in her face&mdash;&ldquo;after such a night, is it not&mdash;natural&mdash;for
      a girl to creep off somewhere by herself and try to think a little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had turned full on her; the answering colour crept to his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that why?&rdquo; he asked slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not a reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my reason&mdash;for being here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bit her bright lip. This trend to the conversation was ominous, and
      she had meant to do her drifting alone in still sun-dreams, fearing no
      witness, no testimony, no judgment save her own self in court with
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose you cannot go&mdash;now,&rdquo; she reflected innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I can, and must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And leave me here to dig in the sand with my heels? Merci!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly do, Mr. Siward. I don't want to dream, now; I don't care to
      reflect. I did, but here you come blundering into my private world and
      upset my calculations and change my intentions! It's a shame, especially
      as you've been lying here doing what I wished to do for goodness knows how
      long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going,&rdquo; he said, looking at her curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are very selfish, Mr. Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will call it that,&rdquo; he said with an odd laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; She seated herself on the sand and calmly shook out her
      skirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what time would you like to be called?&rdquo; he asked smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I shall do no sun-dreaming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please. It is good for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn't good at all. And I am grateful to you for waking me,&rdquo; she
      retorted with a sudden gay malice that subdued him. And she, delicate nose
      in the air, laughingly watching him, went on with her punishment: &ldquo;You see
      what you've done, don't you?&mdash;saved me from an entire morning wasted
      in sentimental reverie over what might have been. Now you can appreciate
      it, can't you?&mdash;your wisdom in appearing in the flesh to save a silly
      girl the effort of evoking you in the spirit! Ah, Mr. Siward, I am vastly
      obliged to you! Pray sit here beside me in the flesh, for fear that in
      your absence I might commit the folly that tempted me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His low running laughter accompanying her voice had stimulated her to a
      gay audacity, which for the instant extinguished in her the little fear of
      him she had been barely conscious of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you also aroused me from my sun-dreams?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I? And can't you resume them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You save me the necessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is a second-hand compliment,&rdquo; she said disdainfully&mdash;&ldquo;a
      weak plagiarism on what I conveyed very wittily. You were probably really
      asleep, and dreaming of bird-murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited for her to finish, then, amused eyes searching, he roamed about
      until high on a little drifted sand dune he found a place for himself; and
      while she watched him indignantly, he curled up in the sunshine, and,
      dropping his head on the hot sand, calmly closed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon&mdash;my word!&rdquo; she breathed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      He unclosed his eyes. &ldquo;Now you may dream; you can't avoid it,&rdquo; he observed
      lazily, and closed his eyes; and neither taunts nor jeers nor questions,
      nor fragments of shells flung with intent to hit, stirred him from his
      immobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tired of the attempt presently, and sat silent, elbows on her thighs,
      hands propping her chin. Thoughts, vague as the fitful breeze, arose,
      lingered, and, like the breeze, faded, dissolved into calm, through which,
      cadenced by the far beat of the ebb tide, her heart echoed, beating the
      steady intervals of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not meant to dream, but as she sat there, the fine-spun golden
      threads flying from the whirling loom of dreams floated about her,
      settling over her, entangling her in unseen meshes, so that she stirred,
      groping amid the netted brightness, drawn onward along dim paths and
      through corridors of thought where, always beyond, vague splendours seemed
      to beckon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now lost, now restless, conscious of the perils of the shining path she
      followed, the rhythm of an ocean soothing her to false security, she
      dreamed on awake, unconscious of the tinted sea and sky which stained her
      eyes to hues ineffable. A long while afterward a small cloud floated
      across the sun; and, in the sudden shadow on the world, doubt sounded its
      tiny voice, and her ears listened, and the enchantment faded and died
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning, she looked across the sand at the man lying there; her eyes
      considered him&mdash;how long she did not know, she did not heed&mdash;until,
      stirring, he looked up; and she paled a trifle and closed her eyes,
      stunned by the sudden clamour of pulse and heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he rose and walked over, she looked up gravely, pouring the last
      handful of white sand through her stretched fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you dream?&rdquo; he asked lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you dream true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of my dream can happen,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You know that,... don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that we love... and that we dare not ignore it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She suffered his arm about her, his eyes looking deeply into hers&mdash;a
      close, sweet caress, a union of lips, and her dimmed eyes' response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;how can you make it so hard for me? How can you
      force me to this shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame?&rdquo; he repeated vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;this treachery to myself&mdash;when I cannot hope to be more to
      you&mdash;when I dare not love you too much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must dare, Sylvia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no! I know myself, I tell you. I cannot give up what is offered&mdash;for
      you!&mdash;dearly, dearly as I do love you!&rdquo; She turned and caught his
      hands in hers, flushed, trembling, unstrung. &ldquo;I cannot&mdash;I simply
      cannot! How can you love me and listen to such wickedness? How can you
      still care for such a girl as I am&mdash;worse than mercenary, because I
      have a heart&mdash;or had, until you took it! Keep it; it is the only part
      of me not all ignoble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will keep it&mdash;in trust,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;until you give yourself with
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she only shook her head wearily, withdrawing her hands from his, and
      for a time they sat silent, eyes apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then&mdash;&ldquo;There is another reason,&rdquo; she said wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at her, hesitated, and&mdash;&ldquo;My habits?&rdquo; he asked simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have them in check.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you&mdash;certain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I may be&mdash;now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; she said timidly, &ldquo;you lost one fight&mdash;since you knew me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dull red mantling his face wrung her heart. She turned impulsively and
      laid both hands on his shoulders. &ldquo;That chance I would take, with all its
      uncertainty, all the dread inheritance you have come into. I love you
      enough for that; and if it turned out that&mdash;that you could not stem
      the tide, even with me to face it with you; and if the pity of it, the
      grief of it, killed me, I would take that chance&mdash;if you loved me
      through it all.... But there is something else. Hush; let me have my say
      while I find the words&mdash;something else you do not understand.... Turn
      your face a little; please don't look at me. This is what you do not know&mdash;that,
      in three generations, every woman of my race has&mdash;gone wrong....
      Every one! and I am beginning&mdash;with such a marriage!... deliberately,
      selfishly, shamelessly, perfectly conscious of the frivolous, erratic
      blood in me, aware of the race record behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once, when I knew nothing&mdash;before I&mdash;I met you&mdash;I believed
      such a marriage would not only permit me mental tranquillity, but safely
      anchor me in the harbour of convention, leaving me free to become what I
      am fashioned to become&mdash;autocrat and arbiter in my own world. And
      now! and now! I don't know&mdash;truly I don't know what I may become.
      Your love forces my hand. I am displaying all the shallowness, falseness,
      pettiness, all the mean, and cruel and callous character which must be
      truly my real self.... Only I shall not marry you! You are not to run the
      risk of what I might prove to be when I remember in bitterness all I have
      renounced. If I married you I should remember, unreconciled, what you cost
      me. Better for you and for me that I marry him, and let him bear with me
      when I remember that he cost me you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bent over, almost double, closing her eyes with small clenched hands;
      and he saw the ring shimmering in the sunshine, and her hair, heavily,
      densely gold, and the white nape of her neck, and the tiny close-set ears,
      and the curved softness of cheek and chin; every smooth, childlike contour
      and mould&mdash;rounded arms, slim, flowing lines of body and limb&mdash;all
      valued at many millions by her as her own appraiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, deep within him, something seemed to fail, die out&mdash;perhaps
      a tiny newly lighted flame of unaccustomed purity, the dawning flicker of
      aspiration to better things. Whatever it was, material, spiritual, was
      gone now, and where it had glimmered for a night, the old accustomed
      twilit doubt crept in&mdash;the same dull acquiescence&mdash;the same
      uncertainty of self, the familiar lack of will, of incentive, the
      congenial tendency to drift; and with it came weariness&mdash;perhaps
      reaction from the recent skirmishes with that master-vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said in a dull voice, &ldquo;you are right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am wrong&mdash;wrong!&rdquo; she said, lifting her lovely face and heavy
      eyes. &ldquo;But I have chosen my path.... And you will forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you hope so, you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, unconvinced, watching a flock of sand-pipers whirling into the
      cove like a gray snow-squall and fearlessly settling on the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while, with a long breath: &ldquo;Then it is settled,&rdquo; she concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she expected corroboration from him she received none; and perhaps she
      was not awaiting it. She sat very still, her eyes lost in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mortimer, peeping down at them over the thicket above, yawned
      impatiently and glanced about him for the most convenient avenue of
      self-effacement when the time arrived.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII PERSUASION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The days of the house-party at Shotover were numbered. A fresh relay of
      guests was to replace them on Monday, and so they were making the most of
      the waning week on lawn and marsh, in covert and blind, or motoring madly
      over the State, or riding in parties to Vermillion Light. Tennis and lawn
      bowls came into fashion; even water polo and squash alternated on days too
      raw for more rugged sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      And during all these days Beverly Plank appeared with unflagging
      persistence and assiduity, until his familiar, big, round head and
      patient, delft-blue, Dutch eyes became a matter of course at Shotover,
      indoors and out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not that he was either accepted, tolerated, or endured; he was
      simply there, and nobody took the trouble to question his all-pervading
      presence until everybody had become too much habituated to him to think
      about it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accomplished establishment of Beverly Plank was probably due as much
      to his own obstinate and good-tempered persistence as to Mrs. Mortimer. He
      was a Harvard graduate&mdash;there are all kinds of them&mdash;enormously
      wealthy, and though he had no particular personal tastes to gratify, he
      was willing and able to gratify the tastes of others. He did whatever
      anybody else did, and did it well enough to be amusing; and as lack of
      intellectual development never barred anybody from any section of the
      fashionable world, it seemed fair to infer that he would land where he
      wanted to, sooner or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Mrs. Mortimer led him about with the confidence that was her
      perquisite; and the chances were that in due time he would have
      house-parties of his own at Black Fells&mdash;not the kind he had wisely
      denied himself the pleasure of giving, with such neighbours as the
      Ferralls to observe, but the sort he desired. However, there were many
      things to be accomplished for him and by him before he could expect to use
      his great yacht and his estates and his shooting boxes and the vast
      granite mansion recently completed and facing Central Park just north of
      the new palaces built on the edges of the outer desert where Fifth Avenue
      fringes the hundreds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, he had become in a measure domesticated at Shotover, and
      Shotover people gradually came to ride, drive, and motor over the Fells,
      which was a good beginning, though not necessarily a promise for anything
      definite in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer, riding a huge chestnut&mdash;he could still wedge himself into a
      saddle&mdash;had now made it a regular practice to affect the jocular
      early-bird squire, and drag Plank out of bed. And Plank, in no position to
      be anything but flattered by such sans gÃªne, laboriously and gratefully
      splashed through his bath, wallowed amid the breakfast plates, and mounted
      a hunter for long and apparently aimless gallops with Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      His acquaintance among people who knew Mortimer being limited, he had no
      means of determining the latter's social value except through hearsay and
      a toadying newspaper or two. Therefore he was not yet aware of Mortimer's
      perennial need of money; and when Mortimer laughingly alluded to his
      poverty, Plank accepted the proposition in a purely comparative sense, and
      laughed, too, his thrifty Dutch soul untroubled by misgivings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Mortimer had come, among other things, on information; how
      much, and precisely of what nature, he was almost too much ashamed to
      admit definitely, even to himself. Still, the idea that had led him into
      this sudden intimacy with Plank, vague or not, persisted; and he was
      always hovering on the edge of hinting at something which might elicit a
      responsive hint from the flattered master of Black Fells.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was much about Plank that was unaffected, genuine, even simple, in
      one sense; he cared for people for their own sakes; and only stubborn
      adherence to a dogged ambition had enabled him to dispense with the
      society of many people he might easily have cultivated and liked&mdash;people
      nearer his own sort; and that, perhaps, was the reason he so readily liked
      Mortimer, whose coarse fibre soon wore through the polish when rubbed
      against by a closer, finer fibre. And Plank liked him aside from
      gratitude; and they got on famously on the basis of such mutual
      recognition. Then, one day, very suddenly, Mortimer stumbled on something
      valuable&mdash;a thread, a mere clew, so astonishing that for an instant
      it absolutely upset all his unadmitted theories and calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nothing&mdash;a vague word or two&mdash;a forced laugh&mdash;and
      the scared silence of this man Plank, who had blundered on the verge of a
      confidence to a man he liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment of amazement, of half-incredulous suspicion, of certainty; and
      Mortimer pounced playfully upon him like a tiger&mdash;a big, fat,
      friendly, jocose tiger:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plank, is that what you're up to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up to! Why, I never thought of such a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haw! haw!&rdquo; roared Mortimer. &ldquo;If you could only see your face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Beverly Plank, red as a beet, comfortably suffused with reassurance
      under the reaction from his scare, attempted to refute the other's
      conclusions: &ldquo;It doesn't mean anything, Mortimer. She's just the
      handsomest girl I ever saw. I know she's engaged. I only admired her a
      lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not the only man,&rdquo; said Mortimer blandly, still striving to
      reconcile his preconceived theories with the awkward half-confession of
      this great, red-fisted, hulking horseman riding at his stirrup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't have her dream,&rdquo; stammered Plank, &ldquo;that I had ever thought of
      such a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? It would only flatter her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flatter a woman who is engaged to marry another man!&rdquo; gasped Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Do you think any woman ever had enough admiration in this
      world?&rdquo; asked Mortimer coolly. &ldquo;And as for Sylvia Landis, she'd be tickled
      to death if anybody hinted that you had ever admired her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; exclaimed Plank, alarmed; &ldquo;You wouldn't make a joke of it!
      you wouldn't be careless about such a thing! And there's Quarrier! I'm not
      on joking terms with him; I'm on most formal terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quarrier!&rdquo; sneered the other, flicking at his stirrup with his crop.
      &ldquo;He's on formal terms with everybody, including himself. He never laughed
      on purpose in his life; once a month only, to keep his mouth in; that's
      his limit. Do you suppose any woman would stand for him if a better man
      looked sideways at her?&rdquo; And, reversing his riding crop, he deliberately
      poked Mr. Plank in the ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;a better man!&rdquo; muttered Plank, scarce crediting his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. A man who can make good, is good; but a man who can make
      better is it with the ladies&mdash;God bless 'em!&rdquo; he added, displaying a
      heavy set of teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beverly Plank knew perfectly well that, in the comparison so delicately
      suggested by Mortimer, his material equipment could be scarcely compared
      to the immense fortune controlled by Howard Quarrier; and as he thought
      it, his reflections were put into words by Mortimer, airily enough:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody stands a chance in a show-down with Quarrier. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank gaped until the tension became unbearable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;what?&rdquo; he blurted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plank,&rdquo; said Mortimer solemnly, and his voice vibrated with feeling, &ldquo;Let
      me do a little thinking before I ask you a&mdash;a vital question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Plank had become agitated again, and he said something so bluntly that
      Mortimer wheeled on him, glowering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Plank: you don't suppose I'm capable of repeating a
      confidence, do you?&mdash;if you choose to make me understand it's a
      confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't a confidence; it isn't anything; I mean it is confidential, of
      course. All there's in it is what I said&mdash;or rather what you took me
      up on so fast,&rdquo; ended Plank, abashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About your being in love with Syl&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it!&rdquo; roared Plank, crimson to his hair; and he set his heavy
      spurs to his mount and plunged forward in a storm of dust. Mortimer
      followed, silent, profoundly immersed in his own thoughts and deductions;
      and as he pounded along, turning over in his mind all the varied
      information he had so unexpectedly obtained in these last few days, a dull
      excitement stirred him, and he urged his huge horse forward in a thrill of
      rising exhilaration such as seizes on men who hunt, no matter what they
      hunt&mdash;the savage, swimming sense of intoxication which marks the man
      who chases the quarry not for its own value, but because it is his nature
      to chase and ride down and enjoy spoils.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all that afternoon, having taken to his room on pretence of neuralgia,
      he lay sprawled on his bed, thinking, thinking. Not that he meant harm to
      anybody, he told himself very frequently. He had, of course, information
      which certain degraded men might use in a contemptible way, but he,
      Mortimer, did not resemble such men in any particular. All he desired was
      to do Plank a good turn. There was nothing disreputable in doing a wealthy
      man a favour.... And God knew a wealthy man's gratitude was necessary to
      him at that very moment&mdash;gratitude substantially acknowledged.... He
      liked Plank&mdash;wished him well; that was all right, too; but a man is
      an ass who doesn't wish himself well also.... Two birds with one stone....
      Three! for he hated Quarrier. Four!... for he had no love for his wife....
      Besides, it would teach Leila a wholesome lesson&mdash;teach her that he
      still counted; serve her right for her disgusting selfishness about Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, there was to be nothing disreputable in his proceedings; that he would
      be very careful about.... Probably Major Belwether might express his
      gratitude substantially if he, Mortimer, went to him frankly and
      volunteered not to mention to Quarrier the scene he had witnessed between
      Sylvia Landis and Stephen Siward at three o'clock in the morning in the
      corridor; and if, in playful corroboration, he displayed the cap and
      rain-coat and the big fan, all crushed, which objects of interest he had
      discovered later in the bay-window.... Yes, probably Major Belwether would
      be very grateful, because he wanted Quarrier in the family; he needed
      Quarrier in his business.... But, faugh! that was close enough to
      blackmail to rub off!... No!... No! He wouldn't go to Belwether and
      promise any such thing!... On the contrary, he felt it his duty to inform
      Quarrier! Quarrier had a right to know what sort of a girl he was
      threatened with for life!... A man ought not to let another man go blindly
      into such a marriage.... Men owed each other something, even if they were
      not particularly close friends.... And he had always had a respect for
      Quarrier, even a sort of liking for him&mdash;yes, a distinct liking!...
      And, anyhow, women were devils! and it behooved men to get together and
      stand for one another!
    </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier would give her her walking papers damned quick!... And, in her
      humiliation, is there anybody mad enough to fancy that she wouldn't snap
      up Plank in such a fix?... And make it look like a jilt for Quarrier?...
      But Plank must do his part on the minute; Plank must step up in the very
      nick of time; Plank, with his millions and his ambitions, was bound to be
      a winner anyway, and Sylvia might as well be his pilot and use his
      money.... And Plank would be very, very grateful&mdash;very useful, a very
      good friend to have.... And Leila would learn at last that he, Mortimer,
      had cut his wisdom teeth, by God!
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Siward, he amounted to nothing; probably was one of that
      contemptible sort of men who butted in and kissed a pretty girl when he
      had the chance. He, Mortimer, had only disgust for such amateurs of the
      social by-ways; for he himself kept to the highways, like any
      self-respecting professional, even when a tour of the highways sometimes
      carried him below stairs. There was no romantic shilly-shallying
      fol-de-rol about him. Women learned what to expect from him in short
      order. En garde, Madame!&mdash;ou Mademoiselle&mdash;tant pis!
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed to himself and rolled over, digging his head into the pillows
      and stretching his fat hands to ease their congestion. And most of all he
      amused himself with figuring out the exact degree of his wife's
      astonishment and chagrin when, without consulting her, he achieved the
      triumph of Quarrier's elimination and the theatrical entry of Beverly
      Plank upon the stage. He laughed when he thought of Major Belwether, too,
      confounded under the loss of such a nephew-in-law, humiliated, crushed,
      all his misleading jocularity, all his sleek pink-and-white suavity, all
      his humbugging bonhomie knocked out of him, leaving only a rumpled,
      startled old gentleman, who bore an amusing resemblance to a very much
      mussed-up buck-rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haw! haw!&rdquo; roared Mortimer, rolling about in his bed and kicking the
      slippers from his fat feet. Then, remembering that he was supposed to be
      suffering silently in his room, he hunched up to a sitting posture and
      regarded his environment with a subdued grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything seems easy when it seems funny. After all, the matter was
      simple&mdash;absurdly simple. A word to Quarrier, and crack! the match was
      off! Girl mad as a hornet, but staggered, has no explanation to offer; man
      frozen stiff with rage, mute as an iceberg. Then, zip! Enter Beverly Plank&mdash;the
      girl's rescuer at a pinch&mdash;her preserver, the saviour of her &ldquo;face,&rdquo;
       the big, highly coloured, leaden-eyed deus ex machina. Would she take
      fifty cents on the dollar? Would she? to buy herself a new &ldquo;face&rdquo;? And put
      it all over Quarrier? And live happy ever after? Would she? Oh, not at
      all!
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mortimer rolled over in another paroxysm; which wasn't good for him,
      and frightened him enough to lie still awhile and think how best he might
      cut down on his wine and spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main thing, after all, was to promise Plank his opportunity, but not
      tell him how he was to obtain it; for Mortimer had an uneasy idea that
      there was something of the Puritan deep planted under the stolid young
      man's hide, and that he might make some absurd and irrelevant objection to
      the perfectly proper methods employed by his newly self-constituted guide
      and mentor. No; that was no concern of Plank's. All he had to do was to be
      ready. As for Quarrier, anybody could forecast his action when once
      convinced of Sylvia's behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay there pondering several methods of imparting the sad but necessary
      information to Quarrier. One thing was certain: there was not now time
      enough before the house-party dissolved to mould Plank into acquiescent
      obedience. That must be finished in town&mdash;unless Plank invited him to
      stay at the Fells after his time was up at Shotover. By Heaven! That was
      the idea! And there'd be a chance for him at cards!... Only, of course,
      Plank would ask Leila too.... But what did he care! He was no longer
      afraid of her; he'd soon be independent of her and her pittance. Let her
      go to the courts for her divorce! Let her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat up rather suddenly, perplexed with a new idea which, curiously
      enough, had not appealed to him before. The astonishing hint so coolly
      dropped by his wife concerning her fearlessness of divorce proceedings had
      only awakened him to the consciousness of his own vulnerability and
      carelessness of conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it occurred to him, for the first time, that if it were not a mere
      bluff on Leila's part, this sudden coquetting with the question of divorce
      might indicate an ulterior object. Was Leila considering his elimination
      in view of this ulterior object? Was there an ulterior gentleman somewhere
      prepared to replace him? If so, where? And who?
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife's possible indiscretions had never interested him; he simply
      didn't care&mdash;had no curiosity, as long as appearances were
      maintained. And she had preserved appearances with a skill which required
      all the indifferent and easy charity of their set to pretend completely
      deceived everybody. Yes, he gave her credit for that; she had been clever.
      Nobody outside of the social register knew the true state of affairs in
      the house of Leroy Mortimer&mdash;which, after all, was all anybody cared
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, immersed in the details of his dirty little drama, he pondered
      over the possibility of an ulterior gentleman as he moved heavily to and
      fro, dressing himself&mdash;his neuralgia being much better&mdash;and
      presently descended the stairs to find everybody absent, engaged, as a
      servant explained, in a game of water basket-ball in the swimming pool. So
      he strolled off toward the north wing of the house, which had been built
      for the squash-courts and swimming pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a good deal of an uproar in the big gymnasium as Mortimer walked
      in, threading his way through the palms and orange-trees; much splashing
      in the pool, cries and stifled laughter, and the quick rattle of applause
      from the gallery of the squash-courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Page boys and Rena and Eileen on one side were playing the last match
      game against Sylvia, Marion Page, Siward, and Ferrall on the other; the
      big, slippery, glistening ball was flying about through storms of spray.
      Marion caught it, but her brother Gordon got it away; then Ferrall secured
      it and dived toward the red goal; but Rena Bonnesdel caught him under
      water; the ball bobbed up, and Sylvia flung both arms around it with a
      little warning shout and hurled it back at Siward, who shot forward like
      an arrow, his opponents gathering about him in full cry, amid laughter and
      excited applause from the gallery, where Grace Ferrall and Captain Voucher
      were wildly offering odds on the blue, and Alderdene and Major Belwether
      were thriftily booking them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer climbed the slippery, marble stairway as fast as his lack of
      breath permitted, anxious for his share of the harvest if the odds were
      right. He ignored his wife's smilingly ironical offer, seeing no sense in
      bothering about money already inside the family; but he managed to make
      several apparently desirable wagers with Katharyn Tassel and one with
      Beverly Plank, who was also obstinately backing the blues, the losing
      side. Sylvia played forward for the blues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agatha Caithness, sleeves rolled up, tall and slim and strangely pale in
      her white flannels, came from the squash-court with Quarrier to watch the
      finish; and Mortimer observed her sidewise, blinking, irresolute, for he
      had never understood her and was always a trifle afraid of her. A pair of
      icicles, she and Quarrier, with whom he had never been on betting terms;
      so he made no suggestions in that direction, and presently became absorbed
      in the splashing battle below. Indeed, such a dashing of foam and
      showering of spray was taking place that the fronds of the big palms hung
      dripping amid drenched blossoms overweighted and prone on the wet marble
      edges of the pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, through the confused blur of foam and spray, the big, glistening
      ball shot aloft and remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blue! Blue!&rdquo; exclaimed Grace Ferrall, clapping her hands; and a little
      whirlwind of cries and hand clapping echoed from the gallery as the
      breathless swimmers came climbing out of the pool, with scarcely wind
      enough left for a word or strength for a gesture toward the laughing crowd
      above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer, disgusted, turned away, already casting about him for somebody
      to play cards with&mdash;it being his temperament and his temper to throw
      good money after bad. But Quarrier and Miss Caithness had already returned
      to the squash-courts, the majority of the swimmers to their several
      dressing-rooms, and Grace Ferrall's party, equipped for motoring, to the
      lawn, where they lost little time in disappearing into the golden haze
      which a sudden shift of wind had spun out of the cloudless afternoon's
      sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he got Marion, and also, as usual, the two men who had made a
      practice of taking away his money&mdash;Major Belwether and Lord
      Alderdene. He hadn't particularly wanted them; he wanted somebody he could
      play with, like Siward, for example, or even the two ten-dollar Pages; not
      that their combined twenty would do him much good, but it would at least
      permit him the pleasures of the card-table without personal loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Pages had retired to dress, and Voucher was for motoring, and he
      had no use for his wife, and he was afraid of Plank's game, and Siward,
      seated on the edge of the pool and sharing a pint of ginger-ale with
      Sylvia Landis, shook his head at the suggestion and resumed his division
      of the ginger-ale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank and Leila Mortimer came down to congratulate them. Sylvia, always
      instinctively and particularly nice to people of Plank's sort whom she
      occasionally encountered, was so faultlessly amiable, that Plank, who had
      never before permitted himself the privilege of monopolising her, found
      himself doing it so easily that it kept him in a state of persistent
      mental intoxication.
    </p>
    <p>
      That slow, sweet, upward training inflection to a statement which
      instantly became a confided question was an unconscious trick which had
      been responsible, in Sylvia's brief life, for more mistakes than anything
      else. Like others before him, Beverly Plank made the mistake that the
      sweetness of voice and the friendliness of eyes were particularly personal
      to him, in tribute to qualities he had foolishly enough hitherto not
      suspected in himself. Now he suspected them, and whatever of real
      qualities desirable had been latent in him also appeared at once,
      confirming his modest suspicions. Certainly he was a wit! Was not this
      perfectly charming girl's responsive and delicious laughter proof enough?
      Certainly he was epigrammatic! Certainly he could be easy, polished,
      amusing, sympathetic, and vastly interesting all the while. Could he not
      divine it in her undivided attention, the quick, amused flicker of
      recognition animating her beautiful face when he had turned a particularly
      successful phrase or taken a verbal hurdle without a cropper? And above
      all, her kindness to him impressed him; her natural and friendly pleasure
      in being agreeable. Here he was already on an informal footing with one of
      the persons of whom he had been most shy and uncertain. If people were
      going to be as considerate of him as she had proved, why&mdash;why&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      His dull, Dutch-blue eyes returned to her, fascinated. The conquest of
      what he desired and meant to have became merged in a vague plan which
      included such a marriage as he had dreamed of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody had once told him that a man who could afford to dress for dinner
      could go anywhere; meaning that, being a man, nature had fitted his feet
      with the paraphernalia for climbing as high as he cared to climb.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was just enough truth in the statement to determine him to use his
      climbing irons; and he had done so, carrying his fortune with him, which
      had proved neither an impediment nor an aid so far. But now he had
      concluded that neither his god-sent climbing irons, his amiability, his
      obstinacy, his mild, tireless persistency, nor his money counted. It had
      come to a crisis where personal worth and sterling character must carry
      him through sheer merit to the inner temple&mdash;that inner temple of raw
      gold whose altars are served by a sexless skeleton in cap and bells!
    </p>
    <p>
      Siward, inclined to be amused by the duration of the trance into which
      Plank had fallen, watched the progress of that bulky young man's
      infatuation as he sat there on the pool's marble edge, exchanging trivial
      views on trivial subjects with Mrs. Leroy Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her conversation, even when inconsequential, was never wearisome
      except when she made it so for her husband's benefit. Features, person,
      personality, and temperament were warmly exotic; her dark eyes with their
      slight Japanese slant, the clear olive skin with its rose bloom, the
      temptation of mouth and slender neck, were always provocative of the
      audacity in men which she could so well meet with amusement or surprise,
      or at times with a fascinating audacity of her own wholly charming because
      of its setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, in their history, during her early married life, Siward had been
      very sentimental about her; but neither he nor she had approached the
      danger line closer than to make daring eyes at one another across the
      frontiers of good taste. And their youthful enchantment had faded so
      naturally, so pleasantly, that always there had remained to them both an
      agreeable after-taste&mdash;a sort of gay understanding which almost
      invariably led to mutual banter when they encountered. But now something
      appeared to be lacking in their rather listless badinage&mdash;something
      of the usual flavour which once had salted even a laughing silence with
      significance. Siward, too, had ceased to be amused at the spectacle of
      Plank's calf-like infatuation; and Leila Mortimer's bored smile had lasted
      so long that her olive-pink cheeks were stiff, and she relaxed her fixed
      features with a little shrug that was also something of a shiver. Then,
      looking prudently around, she encountered Siward's eyes; and during a
      moment's hesitation they considered one another with an increasing
      curiosity that slowly became tentative intelligence. And her eyes said
      very plainly and wickedly to Siward's: &ldquo;Oho, my friend! So it bores you to
      see Mr. Plank monopolising an engaged girl who belongs to Howard
      Quarrier!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And his eyes, wincing, denying, pretending ignorance too late, suddenly
      narrowed in vexed retaliation: &ldquo;Speak for yourself, my lady! You're no
      more pleased than I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next moment they both regretted the pale flash of telepathy. There had
      been something wounded in his eyes; and she had not meant that. No; a new
      charity for the hapless had softened her wonderfully within a fortnight's
      time, and a self-pity, not entirely ignoble, had subdued the brilliancy of
      her dark eyes, and made her tongue more gentle in dealing with all
      failings. Besides, she was not yet perfectly certain what ailed her, never
      having really cared for any one man before. No, she was not at all
      certain.... But in the meanwhile she was very sorry for herself, and for
      all those who drained the bitter cup that might yet pass from her
      shrinking lips. Who knows! &ldquo;Stephen,&rdquo; she said under her breath, &ldquo;I didn't
      mean to hurt you.... Don't scowl. Listen. I have already entirely
      forgotten the nature of my offense. Pax, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He refused to understand; and she understood that, too; and she gazed
      critically upon Sylvia Landis as a very young mother might inspect a rival
      infant with whom her matchless offspring was coquetting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, without appearing to, she took Plank away from temptation; so
      skilfully that nobody except Siward understood that the young man had been
      incontinently removed. He, Plank, never doubting that he was a perfectly
      free agent, decided that the time had arrived for triumphant retirement.
      It had; but Leila Mortimer, not he, had rendered the decision, and so
      cleverly that it appeared even to Plank himself that he had dragged her
      off with him rather masterfully. Clearly he was becoming a devil of a
      fellow!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia turned to Siward, glanced up at him, hesitated, and began to laugh
      consciously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of my latest sentimental acquisition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd be an ornament to a stock farm,&rdquo; replied Siward, out of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How brutal you can be!&rdquo; she mused, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! He's a plain bounder, isn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.... Is he? He struck me a trifle appealingly&mdash;even
      pathetically; they usually do, that sort.... As though the trouble they
      took could ever be worth the time they lose!... There are dozens of men I
      know who are far less presentable than this highly coloured and robust
      young human being; and yet they are part of the accomplished scheme of
      things&mdash;like degenerate horses, you know&mdash;always pathetic to me;
      but they're still horses, for all that. Quid rides? Species of the same
      genus can cross, of course, but I had rather be a donkey than a mule.
      ...And if I were a donkey I'd sing and cavort with my own kind, and let
      horses flourish their own heels inside the accomplished scheme of
      things.... Now I have been brutal. But&mdash;I'm easily coloured by my
      environment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat, smiling maliciously down at the water, smoothing out the soaked
      skirt of her swimming suit, and swinging her legs reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you reconciled?&rdquo; she asked presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To leaving Shotover. To-day is our last day, you know. To-morrow we all
      go; and next day these familiar walls will ring with other voices, my poor
      friend:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yon rising moon that looks for us again&mdash;How oft hereafter will she
      wax and wane; How oft hereafter, rising, look for us Through this same
      mansion&mdash;and for one in vain!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is I&mdash;the one, you know. You may be here again; but I&mdash;I
      shall not be I if I ever come to Shotover again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her stockinged heels beat the devil's tattoo against the marble sides of
      the pool. She reached up above her head, drawing down a flowering branch
      of Japanese orange, and caressed her delicate nose with the white
      blossoms, dreamily, then, mischievously: &ldquo;I'm accustoming myself to this
      most significant perfume,&rdquo; she said, looking at him askance. And she
      deliberately hummed the wedding march, watching the colour rise in his
      sullen face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had the courage of a sparrow you'd make life worth something for
      us both,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it; I haven't; but I seem to possess the remainder of his
      lordship's traits&mdash;inconsequence, self-centred selfishness, the
      instinct for Fifth Avenue nest-building&mdash;all the feathered vices, all
      the unlovely personality and futility and uselessness of my prototype....
      Only, as you observe, I lack the quality of courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how much courage it requires to do what you're going to do,&rdquo;
       he said sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you? Sometimes, when you wear a scowl like that, I think that it
      may require no more courage than I am capable of.... And sometimes&mdash;I
      don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She crossed her knees, one slender ankle imprisoned in her hand, leaning
      forward thoughtfully above the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our last day,&rdquo; she mused; &ldquo;for we shall never be just you and I again&mdash;never
      again, my friend, after we leave this rocky coast of Eden. ...I shall have
      hints of you in the sea-wind and the sound of the sea; in the perfume of
      autumn woods, in the whisper of stirring leaves when the white birches put
      on their gold crowns next year.&rdquo; She smiled, turning to him, a little
      gravely: &ldquo;When the Lesser Children return with April, I shall not forget
      you, Mr. Siward, nor forget your mercy of a day on them; nor your
      comradeship, nor your sweetness to me.... Nor your charity for me, nor all
      that you overlook so far in me,&mdash;under the glamour of a spell that
      seems to hold you still, and that still holds me.... I can answer for my
      constancy so far, until one more spring and summer have come and gone&mdash;until
      one more autumn comes, and while it lasts&mdash;as long as any semblance
      of the setting remains which had once framed you; I can answer for my
      constancy as long as that.... Afterwards, the snow!&mdash;symbol of our
      separation. I am to be married a year from November first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at her in dark surprise, for he had heard that their wedding
      date had been set for the coming winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A year's engagement?&rdquo; he repeated, unconvinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my wish. I think that is sufficient for everybody concerned.&rdquo;
       Then, averting her face, which had suddenly lost a little of its colour:
      &ldquo;A year is little enough,&rdquo; she said impatiently. &ldquo;I&mdash;what has
      happened to us requires an interval&mdash;a decent interval for its
      burial.... Death is respectable in any form. What dies between you and me
      can have no resurrection under the snow.... So I bring to the burial my
      tribute&mdash;a year of life, a year of constancy, my friend; symbol of an
      eternity I could have given you had I been worth it.&rdquo; She looked up,
      flushed, the forced smile stamped on lips still trembling. &ldquo;Sentiment in
      such a woman as I! 'A spectacle for Gods and men,' you are saying&mdash;are
      you not? And perhaps sentiment with me is only an ancient instinct, a
      latent ancestral quality for which I, ages later, have no use.&rdquo; She was
      laughing easily. &ldquo;No use for sentiment, as our bodies have no use for that
      fashionable little cul-de-sac, you know, though wise men say it once
      served its purpose, too.... Stephen Siward, what do you think of me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am learning,&rdquo; he replied simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, if you please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Learning a little about what I am losing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bent forward impulsively, balancing her body on the pool's rim with
      both arms, dropping her knee until her ankles swung interlocked above the
      water. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she said in a low, distinct voice: &ldquo;What you lose is no
      other man's gain! If I warm and expand in your presence&mdash;if I say
      clever things sometimes&mdash;if I am intelligent, sympathetic, and
      amusing&mdash;it is because of you. You inspire it in me. Normally I am
      the sort of girl you first met at the station. I tell you that I don't
      know myself now&mdash;that I have not known myself since I knew you.
      Qualities of understanding, ability to appreciate, to express myself
      without employing the commonplaces, subtleties of intercourse&mdash;all,
      maybe, were latent in me, but sterile, until you came into my life.... And
      when you go, then, lacking impulse and incentive, the new facility, the
      new sensitive alertness, the unconscious self-confidence, all will
      smoulder and die out in me.... I know it; I realise that it was due to you&mdash;part
      of me that I should never have known, of which I should have remained
      totally ignorant, had it not blossomed suddenly, stimulated by you alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the clouded seriousness of her blue eyes cleared, and the smile
      began to glimmer again. &ldquo;That is your revenge; you recommit me to my
      commonplace self; you restore me to my tinsel career, practically a dolt.
      Shame on you, Stephen Siward, to treat a poor girl so!... But it's just as
      well. Blunted perceptions, according to our needs, you know; and so life
      is tempered for us all, else we might not endure it long.... A pleasantly
      morbid suggestion for a day like this, is it not?... Shall we take a
      farewell plunge, and dress? You know we say good-bye to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you go from here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Lenox; the Claymores have asked us for a week; after that, Hot Springs
      for another two weeks or so; after that, to Oyster Bay.... Mr. Quarrier
      opens his house on Sedge Point,&rdquo; she added demurely, &ldquo;but I don't think he
      expects to invite you to 'The Sedges.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long do you stay there?&rdquo; asked Siward irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until we go to town in December.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you find to do all that time in Oyster Bay?&rdquo; he asked more
      irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a premature question! The yacht is there. Besides, there's the usual
      neighbourhood hunting, with the usual packs and inevitable set; the usual
      steeple-chasing; the usual exchange of social amenities; the usual driving
      and riding; the usual, my poor friend, the usual, in all its
      uncompromising certainty.... And what are you to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After you leave here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know where you are going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but haven't you been asked somewhere? You have, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I have declined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matters of business,&rdquo; she inferred. &ldquo;Too bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she concluded, laughing, &ldquo;you don't care to tell me where you are
      going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;I don't care to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed again carelessly, and, placing one hand on the tiled pavement,
      sprang lightly to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A last plunge?&rdquo; she asked, as he rose at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, one last plunge together. Deep! Are you ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her white arms above her head, finger-tips joined, poised an
      instant on the brink, swaying forward; then, at his brief word, they
      flashed downward together, cutting the crystalline sea-water, shooting
      like great fish over the glass-tiled bed, shoulder to shoulder under the
      water; and opening their eyes, they turned toward one another with a swift
      outstretch of hands, an uncontrollable touch of lips, the very shadow of
      contact; then cleaving upward, rising to the surface to lie breathlessly
      floating, arms extended, and the sun filtering down through the
      ground-glass roof above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are perfectly crazy,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;I'm quite mad; I see that. On
      land it's bad enough for us to misbehave; but submarine sentiment! We'll
      be growing scales and tails presently.... Did you ever hear of a Southern
      bird&mdash;a sort of hawk, I think&mdash;that almost never alights; that
      lives and eats and sleeps its whole life away on the wing? and even its
      courtship, and its honeymoon? Grace Ferrall pointed one out to me last
      winter, near Palm Beach&mdash;a slender bird, part black, part snowy
      white, with long, pointed, delicate wings like an enormous swallow; and
      all day, all night, it floats and soars and drifts in the upper air, never
      resting, never alighting except during its brief nesting season.... Think
      of the exquisite bliss of drifting one's life through in mid-air&mdash;to
      sleep, balanced on light wings, upborne by invisible currents flowing
      under the stars&mdash;to sail dreamily through the long sunshine, to float
      under the moon!... And at last, I suppose, when its time has come, down it
      whirls out of the sky, stone dead!... There is something thrilling in such
      a death&mdash;something magnificent.... And in the exquisitely spiritual
      honeymoon, vague as the shadow of a rainbow, is the very essence and aroma
      of that impalpable Paradise we women prophesy in dreams!... More
      sentiment! Heigho! My brother is the weeping crocodile, and the five winds
      are my wits.... Shall we dress? Even with a maid and the electric
      air-blast it will take time to dry my hair and dress it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he came out of his dressing-room she was apparently still in the
      hands of the maid. So he sauntered through the house as far as the
      library, and drawing a cheque-book from one pocket, fished out a
      memorandum-book from another, and began to cast up totals with a view to
      learning something about the various debts contracted at Shotover.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to owe everybody. Fortune had smitten him hip and thigh; and, a
      trifle concerned, he began covering a pad with figures until he knew where
      he stood. Then he drew a considerable cheque to Major Belwether's order,
      another to Alderdene. Others followed to other people for various amounts;
      and he was very busily at work when, aware of another presence near, he
      turned around in his chair. Sylvia Landis was writing at a desk in the
      corner, and she looked up, nodding the little greeting that she always
      reserved for him even after five minutes' separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm writing cheques,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I suppose you're writing to your
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo; he asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You write to her every day, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but how do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with unblushing deliberation. &ldquo;You wrote every day....
      If it was to a woman, I wanted to know.... And I told Grace Ferrall that
      it worried me. And then Grace told me. Is there any other confession of my
      own pettiness that I can make to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you really care to whom I was writing?&rdquo; he asked slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Care? I&mdash;it worried me. Was it not a pitifully common impulse?
      'Sisters under our skin,' you know&mdash;I and the maid who dresses me.
      She would have snooped; I didn't; that's the only generic difference. I
      wanted to know just the same.... But&mdash;that was before&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I&mdash;please don't ask me to say it.... I did, once, when you
      asked me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you cared for me. Is that what you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You are so cruelly literal when you wish to punish me.... You are
      interrupting me, too. I owe that wretched Kemp Ferrall a lot of money, and
      I'm trying to find out how much seven and nine are, to close accounts with
      Marion Page.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward turned and continued his writing. And when the little sheaf of
      cheques was ready he counted them, laid them aside, and, drawing a flat
      packet of fresh bank-notes from his portfolio, counted out the tips
      expected of him below stairs. These arranged for, he straightened up and
      glanced over his shoulder at Sylvia, but she was apparently absorbed in
      counting something on the ends of her fingers, so he turned smilingly to
      his desk and wrote a long letter to his mother&mdash;the same tender,
      affectionately boyish letter he had always written her, full of
      confidences, full of humour, gaily anticipating his own return to her on
      the heels of the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his first letter to her from Shotover he had spoken casually of a Miss
      Landis. It seemed the name was familiar enough to his mother, who asked
      about her; and he had replied in another letter or two, a trifle emphatic
      in his praise of her, because from his mother's letters it was quite
      evident that she knew a good deal concerning the very unconventional
      affairs of Sylvia's family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of his swift and somewhat equivocal courtship he had had nothing to say in
      his letters; in fact recently he had nothing to say about Sylvia at all,
      reserving that vital confidence for the clear sympathy and understanding
      which he looked forward to when he should see her, and which, through dark
      days and bitter aftermaths, through struggle and defeat by his
      master-vice, had never failed him yet, never faltered for an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he brought his letter to a close with a tender and uneasy inquiry
      concerning her health, which, she had intimated, was not exactly
      satisfactory, and for that reason she had opened the house in town in
      order to be near Dr. Grisby, their family doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sealing and directing the letter, he looked up to see Sylvia standing at
      his elbow. She dropped a light hand on his shoulder for a second, barely
      touching him&mdash;a fugitive caress, delicate as the smile hovering on
      her lips, as the shy tenderness in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More letters to your sweetheart?&rdquo; she asked, abandoning her hand to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more&mdash;the last before I see her.... I wish you could see her,
      Sylvia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish so, too,&rdquo; she answered simply, seating herself on the arm of his
      chair as though it were a side-saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat there very silent for a few moments, curiously oblivious to the
      chance curiosity of any one who might enter or pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would she&mdash;care for me&mdash;do you think?&rdquo; asked the girl in a low
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&mdash;for your real self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. She could only feel contempt for me&mdash;as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is old-fashioned,&rdquo; he said reverently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means all that is best in a woman.... The old fashion of truth and
      faith; the old fashion of honour, and faith in honour; the old, old
      fashion of&mdash;love.... All that is best, Stephen; all that is worth the
      love of a man.... Some day somebody will revive those fashions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, they would not become me,&rdquo; she said, the tenderness in her eyes
      deepening a little; and she touched his head lightly in humourous caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do with the waning daylight?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;It is my last day
      with you. I told Howard it was my last day with you, and I did not care to
      be disturbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You probably didn't say it that way,&rdquo; he commented, amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much of that sort of thing is he prepared to stand?&rdquo; asked Siward
      curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much? I don't know. I don't believe he cares. It is my uncle, Major
      Belwether, who is making things unpleasant for me. I had to tell Howard,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Siward incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Do you think my conduct has passed without protest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told Quarrier!&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you imagine I could do otherwise?&rdquo; she asked coolly. &ldquo;I have that
      much decency left. Certainly I told him. Do you suppose that, after what
      we did&mdash;what I admitted to you&mdash;that I could meet him as usual?
      Do you think I am afraid of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were afraid of losing him,&rdquo; muttered Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was, dreadfully. And the morning after you and I had been imprudent
      enough to sit up until nearly daylight&mdash;and do what we did&mdash;I
      made him take a long walk with me, and I told him plainly that I cared for
      you, that I was too selfish and cowardly to marry you, and that if he
      couldn't endure the news he was at liberty to terminate the engagement
      without notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; stammered Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A number of practical things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say he stands it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears so. What else is there for him to do, unless he breaks the
      engagement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he&mdash;hasn't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I was informed that he held me strictly and precisely to my promise;
      that he would never release me voluntarily, though I was, of course, at
      liberty to do what I chose.... My poor friend, he cares no more for love
      than do I. I happen to be the one woman in New York whom he considers
      absolutely suitable for him; by race, by breeding, by virtue of appearance
      and presence, eminently fitted to complete the material portion of his
      fortune and estate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice had hardened as she spoke; now it rang a little at the end, and
      she laughed unpleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears that I was a little truer to myself than you gave me credit
      for&mdash;a little truer to you&mdash;a little less treacherous, less
      shameless, than you must have thought me. But I have gone to my limit of
      decency; ...and, were I ten times more in love with you than I am, I could
      not put away the position and power offered me. But I will not lie for it,
      nor betray for it.... Do you remember, once you asked me for what reasons
      I dropped men from my list? And I told you, because of any falsehood or
      treachery, any betrayal of trust&mdash;and for no other reason. You
      remember? And did you suppose that elemental standard of decency did not
      include women&mdash;even such a woman as I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped one arm on the back of his chair and rested her chin on it,
      staring at space across his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's how it had to be, you see, when I found that I cared for you.
      There was nothing to do but to tell him. I was quite certain that it was
      all off; but I found that I didn't know the man. I knew he was sensitive,
      but I didn't know he was sensitive to personal ridicule only, and to
      nothing else in all the world that I can discover. I&mdash;I suppose, from
      my frankness to him, he has concluded that no ridicule could ever touch
      him through me. I mean, he trusts me enough to marry me.... He will be
      safe enough, as far as my personal conduct is concerned,&rdquo; she added
      naively. &ldquo;It seems that I am capable of love; but I am incapable of its
      degradation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward, leaning heavily forward over his desk, rested his head in both
      hands; and she stooped from her perch on the arm of the chair, pressing
      her hot cheeks against his hands&mdash;a moment only; then slipping to her
      feet, she curled up in a great arm-chair by the fire, head tipped back,
      blue gaze concentrated on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing for you to do,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is to ambush me some night, and
      throw me into a hansom, and drive us both to the parson's. I'd hate you
      for it as much as I'd love you, but I'd make you an interesting wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may do that yet,&rdquo; he said, lifting his head from his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've a year to do it in,&rdquo; she observed.... &ldquo;By the way, you're to take
      me in to dinner, as you did the first night. Do you remember? I asked
      Grace Ferrall then. I asked her again to-day. Heigho! It was years ago,
      wasn't it, that I drove up to the station and saw a very attractive and
      perplexed young man looking anxiously about for somebody to take him to
      Shotover. Ahem! the notorious Mr. Siward! Dear,... I didn't mean to hurt
      you! You know it, silly! Mayn't I have my little joke about your badness&mdash;your
      redoubtable badness of reputation? There! You had just better smile....
      How dare you frighten me by making me think I had hurt you!... Besides,
      you are probably unrepentant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She watched him closely for a moment or two, then, &ldquo;Are you unrepentant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About your general wickedness? About&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;about
      that girl, for example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What girl?&rdquo; he asked coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That reminds me that you have told me absolutely nothing about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to tell,&rdquo; he said, in a tone so utterly new to her in
      its finality that she sat up as though listening to an unknown voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tone and words so completely excluded her from the new intimacy into which
      she had imperceptibly drifted that both suddenly developed a significance
      from sheer contrast. Who was this girl, then, of whom he had absolutely
      nothing to say? What was she to him? What could she be to him&mdash;an
      actress, a woman of common antecedents?
    </p>
    <p>
      She had sometimes idly speculated in an indefinitely innocent way as to
      just what a well-born man could find to interest him in such women; what
      he could have to talk about to persons of that sort, where community of
      tastes and traditions must be so absolutely lacking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gossip, scandal of that nature, hints, silences, innuendoes, the wise
      shrugs of young girls oversophisticated, the cool, hard smiles of matrons,
      all had left her indifferent or bored, partly from distaste, partly from
      sheer incredulity; a refusal to understand, an innate delicacy that not
      only refrains from comprehension, but also denies itself even the
      curiosity to inquire or the temptation of vaguest surmise on a subject
      that could not exist for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, something of the uncomfortable uneasiness had come over her which
      she had been conscious of when made aware of Marion Page's worldly wisdom,
      and which had imperceptibly chilled her when Grace Ferrall spoke of
      Siward's escapade, coupling this woman and him in the same scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it for granted that there must be, for men, an attraction toward
      women who figured publicly behind the foot-lights, though it appeared very
      silly to her. In fact it all was silly and undignified&mdash;part and
      parcel, no doubt, of that undergraduate foolishness which seemed to cling
      to some men who had otherwise attained discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it appeared to her that Siward had taken the matter with a seriousness
      entirely out of proportion in his curt closure of the subject, and she
      felt a little irritated, a little humiliated, a little hurt, and took
      refuge in a silence that he did not offer to break.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early twilight had fallen in the room; the firelight grew redder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvia,&rdquo; he said abruptly, reverting to the old, light tone hinting of
      the laughter in his eyes which she could no longer see, &ldquo;Suppose, as you
      suggested, I did ambush you&mdash;say after the opera&mdash;seize you
      under the very nose of your escort and make madly for a hansom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know of no other way,&rdquo; she said demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you resist, physically?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would, if nobody were looking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Desperately?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know? Besides, it couldn't last long,&rdquo; she said, thinking of his
      slimly powerful build as she had noticed it in his swimming costume.
      Smiling, amused, she wondered how long she could resist him with her own
      wholesome supple activity strengthened to the perfection of health in
      saddle and afoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should advise you to chloroform me,&rdquo; she said defiantly. &ldquo;You don't
      realise my accomplishments with the punching-bag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you mean to resist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do. If I were going to surrender at once, I might as well go off
      to church with you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wenniston church!&rdquo; he said promptly. &ldquo;I'll order the Mercedes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, lazily settling herself more snugly by the fire. &ldquo;Suppose it
      were our fire?&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;There would be a dog lying across that rug,
      and a comfortable Angora tabby dozing by the fender, and&mdash;you,
      cross-legged, at my feet, with that fascinating head of yours tipped back
      against my knees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The laughter in her voice died out, and he had risen, saying unsteadily:
      &ldquo;Don't! I&mdash;I can't stand that sort of thing, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had made a mistake, too; she also had suddenly become aware of her own
      limits in the same direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, dear! I meant no mockery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know.... After a while a man finds laughter difficult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not laughing at&mdash;anything. I was only pretending to be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your happiness is before you,&rdquo; he said sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My future, you mean. You know I am exchanging one for the other.... And
      some day you will awake to the infamy of it; you will comprehend the
      depravity of the monstrous trade I made.... And then&mdash;and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed one slim hand over her face&mdash;&ldquo;then you will shake yourself
      free from this dream of me; then, awake, my punishment at your hands will
      begin.... Dear, no man in his right senses can continue to love a girl
      such as I am. All that is true and ardent and generous in you has invested
      my physical attractiveness and my small intellect with a magic that cannot
      last, because it is magic; and you are the magician, enmeshed for the
      moment in the mists of your own enchantment. When this fades, when you
      unclose your eyes in clear daylight, dear, I dread to think what I shall
      appear to you&mdash;what a dreadful, shrunken, bloodless shell, hung with
      lace and scented, silken cerements&mdash;a jewelled mummy-case&mdash;a
      thing that never was!... Do you understand my punishment a little, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were true,&rdquo; he said in a dull voice, &ldquo;you will have forgotten,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray I may,&rdquo; she said under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, after a long silence: &ldquo;Do you think, before the year is out, that you
      might be granted enough courage?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I shall not even pray for it. I want what is offered me! I desire it
      so blindly that already it has become part of me. I tell you the poison is
      in every vein; there is nothing else but poison in me. I am what I tell
      you, to the core. It is past my own strength of will to stop me, now. If I
      am stopped, another must do it. My weakness for you, being a treachery if
      not confessed, I was obliged to confess, horribly frightened as I was. He
      might have stopped me; he did not.... And now, what is there on earth to
      halt me? Love cannot. Common decency and courage cannot. Fear of your
      unhappiness and mine cannot. No, even the certitude of your contempt, some
      day, is powerless to halt me now. I could not love; I am utterly incapable
      of loving you enough to balance the sacrifice. And that is final.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace Ferrall came into the room and found a duel of silence in progress
      under the dull fire-glow tinting the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another quarrel,&rdquo; she commented, turning on the current of the drop-light
      above the desk from which Siward had risen at her entrance. &ldquo;You quarrel
      enough to marry. Why don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we could,&rdquo; said Sylvia simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace laughed. &ldquo;What a little fool you are!&rdquo; she said tenderly, seating
      herself in Siward's chair and dropping one hand over his where it rested
      on the arm. &ldquo;Stephen, can't you make her&mdash;a big, strong fellow like
      you? Oh, well; on your heads be it! My conscience is now clear for the
      first time, and I'll never meddle again.&rdquo; She gave Siward's hand a
      perfunctory pat and released him with a discreetly stifled yawn. &ldquo;I'm
      disgracefully sleepy; the wind blew like fury along the coast. Sylvia,
      have you had a good time at Shotover&mdash;the time of your life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia raised her eyes and encountered Siward's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly have,&rdquo; she said faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C'est bien, chÃ©rie. Can you be as civil, Stephen&mdash;conscientiously?
      Oh, that is very nice of you! But there's one thing: why on earth didn't
      you make eyes at Marion? Life might be one long, blissful carnival of
      horse and dog for you both. Oh, dear! there, I'm meddling again! Pinch me,
      Sylvia, if I ever begin to meddle again! How did you come out at Bridge,
      Stephen? What&mdash;bad as that? Gracious! this is disgraceful&mdash;this
      gambling the way people do! I'm shocked and I'm going up to dress. Are you
      coming, Sylvia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was very gay. The ceremony of christening the Shotover Cup,
      which Quarrier had won, proceeded with presentation speech and a speech of
      acceptance faultlessly commonplace, during which Quarrier wore his smile&mdash;which
      was the only humorous thing he contributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cup was full. Siward eyed it, perplexed, deadly afraid, yet seeing no
      avenue of escape from what must appear a public exhibition of contempt for
      Quarrier if he refused to taste its contents. That meant a bad night for
      him; yet he shrank more from the certain misinterpretation of a refusal to
      drink from the huge loving-cup with its heavy wreath of scented orchids,
      now already on its way toward him, than he feared the waking struggle so
      sure to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marion received the cup, lifted it in both hands, and said distinctly,
      &ldquo;Good Hunting!&rdquo; as she drank to Quarrier. Her brother Gordon took it, and
      drank entirely too much. Then Sylvia lifted it, her white hands half
      buried among the orchids: &ldquo;To you!&rdquo; she murmured for Siward's ear alone;
      then drank gaily, mischievously, &ldquo;To the best shot at Shotover!&rdquo; And
      Siward took the cup: &ldquo;I salute victory,&rdquo; he said, smiling, &ldquo;always, and
      everywhere! To him who takes the fighting chance and wins out! To the best
      man! Health!&rdquo; And he drank as a gentleman drinks, with a gay bow to
      Quarrier, and with death in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, the irony of it struck him so grimly that he laughed; and Sylvia,
      beside him, looked up, dismayed to see the gray change in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she faltered, catching his eye; &ldquo;why do you&mdash;why are
      you so white?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he only smiled, as though he had misunderstood, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The survival of the fittest; that is the only test, after all. The man
      who makes good doesn't whine for justice. There's enough of it in the
      world to go round, and he who misses it gets all that's due him just the
      same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later, at cards, the aromatic odour from Alderdene's decanter roused him
      to fierce desire, but he fought it down until only the deadened, tearing
      ache remained to shake and loosen every nerve. And when Ferrall, finishing
      his usual batch of business letters, arrived to cut in if needed, Siward
      dropped his cards with a shudder, and rose so utterly unnerved that
      Captain Voucher, noticing his drawn face, asked him if he were not ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was leaving on an earlier train than the others, having decided to pass
      through Boston and Deptford, at which latter place he meant to leave
      Sagamore for the winter in care of the manager of his mother's farm. So he
      took a quiet leave of those to whom the civility might not prove an
      interruption&mdash;a word to Alderdene and Voucher as he passed out, a
      quick clasp for Ferrall and for Grace, a carefully and cordially formal
      parting from the Page boys, which pleased them ineffably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eileen and Rena, who had never had half a chance at him, took it now,
      delighted to discipline their faithful Pages; and he submitted in his own
      engagingly agreeable way, and so skilfully that both Eileen and Rena felt
      sorry that they had not earlier understood how civilly anxious he had been
      to devote himself to them alone. And they looked at the Pages,
      exasperated.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the big hall he passed Marion, and stopped to take his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, he would do no hunting this season either at Carysford or with the two
      trial packs at Eastwood. Possibly at Warrenton later, but probably not;
      business threatened to detain him in town more or less.... Of course he'd
      come to see her when she returned to town.... And it had been a jolly
      party, and it was a shame to sound &ldquo;lights out&rdquo; so soon! Good-bye. ...Good
      night. And that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was all, unless he disturbed Sylvia, seated at cards with
      Quarrier and Major Belwether and Leila Mortimer&mdash;and very intent on
      the dummy, very still, and a trifle pallid with the pallor of
      concentration.
    </p>
    <p>
      So&mdash;that was all, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ascending the stairs, a servant handed him a letter bearing the crest of
      the Lenox Club. He pocketed it unopened and continued his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness of his own room he sat down, the devil's own clutch on his
      shrinking nerves, a deathly desire tearing at his very vitals, and every
      vein a tiny trail of fire run riot. He had been too long without it, too
      long to endure the craving aroused by that gay draught from Quarrier's
      loving-cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      The awakened fury of his desire appalled him, and for a while that
      occupied him, enabling him to endure. But fear and dismay soon passed in
      the purely physical distress; he walked the floor, haggard, the sweat
      starting on his face; he lay with clenched hands, stiffened out across the
      bed, deafened by the riotous clamour of his pulses, conscious that he was
      holding out, unconscious how long he could hold out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crisis after crisis swept him; sometimes he found his feet and moved
      blindly about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange periods of calm intervened; sensation seemed deadened; and he
      stood as a man who listens, scarcely daring to breathe lest the enemy
      awake and seize him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned on the light, later, to look for his pipe, and he caught a
      glimpse of himself in the mirror. It was a sick man who stared back at him
      out of hollow eyes, and the physical revulsion shocked him into something
      resembling self-command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; he said fiercely, setting his teeth and staring back at his
      reflected face, &ldquo;I'll kill you yet before I've finished with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he filled his pipe, and opening his bedroom window, sat down, resting
      his arm on the sill. A splendid moon silvered the sea; through the intense
      stillness he heard the surf, magnificently dissonant among the reefs, and
      he listened, fascinated, loathing the tides as he feared and loathed the
      inexorable tides that surged and ebbed with his accursed desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he said to himself, weakly&mdash;for he was deadly tired&mdash;&ldquo;What
      am I making the fight for, anyway?&rdquo; And &ldquo;Who are you making the fight
      for?&rdquo; echoed his heavy pulses.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had asked that question and received that answer before. After all, it
      had been for his mother's sake alone. And now&mdash;and now?&mdash;his
      heart beat out another answer; and before his eyes two other eyes seemed
      to open, fearlessly, sweetly, divinely tender. But they were no longer his
      mother's grave, gray eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the second pipe he remembered his letter. It gave him something to
      do, so he opened it and tried to read it, but for a long while, in his
      confused physical and mental condition, he could make no sense of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little he began to comprehend its purport that his resignation
      was regretfully requested by the governors of the Lenox Club for reasons
      unassigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock of the thing came to him after a while, like a distant, dull
      report long after the flash of the explosion. Well, the affair, bad enough
      at first, was turning worse, that was all. How much of that sort of
      discredit could a man stand and keep his balance?... And what would his
      mother say?
    </p>
    <p>
      Confused from his own physical suffering, the blow had fallen with a
      deadened force on nerves already numbed; but his half-stupefied
      acquiescence had suddenly become a painful recoil when he remembered where
      the brunt of the disgrace would fall&mdash;where the centre of suffering
      must always be, and the keenest grief concentrated. Roused, appalled,
      almost totally unnerved, he stood staring at the letter, beginning to
      realise what it would mean to his mother. A passion of remorse and
      resentment swept him. She must be spared that! There must be some way&mdash;some
      punishment for his offence that could not strike her through him! It was
      wicked, it was contemptible, insane, to strike her! What were the
      governors of the Lenox about&mdash;a lot of snivelling hypocrites,
      pandering to the horrified snobbery at the Patroons! Who were they,
      anyway, to discipline him! Scarce one in fifty among the members of the
      two clubs was qualified to sit in judgment on a Siward!
    </p>
    <p>
      But that tempest of passion and mortification passed, too, leaving him
      standing there, dumb, desperate, staring at the letter crushed in his
      shaking hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must see somebody, some member of the Lenox, and do something&mdash;something!
      Ferrall! Was that Ferrall's step on the landing?
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang to the door and opened it. Quarrier, passing the corridor,
      turned an expressionless visage toward him, and passed on with a nod
      almost imperceptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quarrier!&rdquo; he called, swept by a sudden impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier halted and turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you give me a moment&mdash;here in my room? I won't detain you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The faint trace of surprise faded from Quarrier's face; he quietly
      retraced his steps, and, entering Siward's room, stood silently
      confronting its pallid tenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you sit down a moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier seated himself in the arm-chair by the window, and Siward found a
      chair opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quarrier,&rdquo; said the younger man, turning a tensely miserable face on his
      visitor, &ldquo;I want to ask you something. I'll not mince matters. You know
      that the Patroons have dropped me, and you know what for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was called before the Board of Governors to explain the matter, if
      I could, you were sitting on that Board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I denied the charge, but refused to explain.... You remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier nodded coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I was dropped by the club!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slight inclination of Quarrier's symmetrical head corroborated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Siward, slowly and very distinctly, &ldquo;I shall tell you
      unofficially what I refused to tell the other governors officially.&rdquo; And,
      as he began speaking, Quarrier's face flushed, then the features became
      immobile, set, and inert, and his eyes grew duller and duller, as though,
      under a smooth surface the soul inside of him was shrinking back into some
      dark corner, silent, watchful, suspicious, and perhaps defiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Quarrier,&rdquo; said Siward quietly, &ldquo;I did not take that girl to the
      Patroons Club&mdash;and you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier was all surface now; he had drawn away internally so far that
      even his eyes seemed to recede until they scarcely glimmered through the
      slits in his colourless mask. And Siward went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew perfectly well what sort of women I was to meet at that fool
      supper Billy Fleetwood gave; and you must have, too, for the girl you took
      in was no stranger to you.... Her name is Lydia Vyse, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The slightest possible glimmer in the elder man's eyes was all the answer
      he granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened,&rdquo; said Siward calmly, &ldquo;was this: She bet me she could so
      disguise herself that I could safely take her into any club in New York. I
      bet her she couldn't. I never dreamed of trying. Besides, she was your&mdash;dinner
      partner,&rdquo; he added with a shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      His concentrated gaze seemed at length to pierce the expressionless
      surface of the other man, who moved slightly in his chair and moistened
      his thin lips under the glossy beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quarrier,&rdquo; said Siward earnestly, &ldquo;What happened in the club lobby I
      don't exactly know, because I was not in a condition to know. I admit it;
      that was the trouble with me. When I left Fleetwood's rooms I left with a
      half dozen men. I remember crossing Fifth Avenue with them; and the next
      thing I remember distinctly was loud talking in the club lobby, and a
      number of men there, and a slim young fellow in Inverness and top hat in
      the centre of a crowd, whose face was the face of that girl, Lydia Vyse.
      And that is absolutely all. But I couldn't do more than deny that I took
      her there unless I told what I knew; and of course that was not possible,
      even in self-defence. But it was for you to admit that I was right. And
      you did not. You dared not! You let another man blunder into your private
      affairs and fall a victim to circumstantial evidence which you could have
      refuted; and it was up to you to say something! And you did not!... And
      now&mdash;what are you going to do? The Lenox Club has taken this thing
      up. A man can't stand too much of that sort of thing. What am I to do? I
      can't defend myself by betraying my accidental knowledge of your petty,
      private affairs. So I leave it to you. I ask you what are you going to
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&rdquo;&mdash;Quarrier's voice was not his own, and he brought it
      harshly under command&mdash;&ldquo;do you mean that you think it necessary for
      me to say I knew her? What object would be attained by that? I did not
      take her to the Patroons'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor did I. Ask her how she got there. Learn the truth from her, man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What proof is there that I ever met her before I took her into supper at
      Fleetwood's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proof! Are you mad? All I ask of you is to say to the governors what I
      cannot say without using your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish me,&rdquo; asked Quarrier icily, &ldquo;to deny that you made that wager? I
      can do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't do it! I did make that bet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Then, what is it you wish me to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell them the truth. Tell them you know I did not take her to the club.
      You need not tell them why you know it. You need not tell them how much
      you know about her, whose brougham she drove home in. I can't defend
      myself at your expense&mdash;intrench myself behind your dirty little
      romance. What could I say? I denied taking her to the club. Then Major
      Belwether confronted me with my wager. Then I shut up. And so did you,
      Quarrier&mdash;so did you, seated there among the governors, between Leroy
      Mortimer and Belwether. It was up to you, and you did not stir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stir!&rdquo; echoed the other man, exasperated. &ldquo;Of course I did not stir. What
      did I know about it? Do you think I care to give a man like Mortimer a
      hold on me by admitting I knew anything?&mdash;or Belwether&mdash;do you
      think I care to have that man know anything about my private and personal
      business? Did you expect me to say that I was in a position to prove
      anything one way or another? And,&rdquo; he added with increasing harshness,
      &ldquo;how do you know what I might or might not prove? If she went to the
      Patroons Club, I did not go with her; I did not see her; I don't know
      whether or not you took her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already told you that I did not take her,&rdquo; said Siward, turning
      whiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told that to the governors, too. Tell them again, if you like. I
      decline to discuss this matter with you. I decline to countenance your
      unwarranted intrusion into what you pretend to believe are my private
      affairs. I decline to confer with Belwether or Mortimer. It's enough that
      you are inclined to meddle&mdash;&rdquo; His cold anger was stirring. He rose to
      his full, muscular height, slow, menacing, his long, pale fingers twisting
      his silky beard. &ldquo;It's enough that you meddle!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;As for the
      matter in question, a dozen men, including myself, heard you make a wager;
      and later I myself was a witness that the terms of that wager had been
      carried out to the letter. I know absolutely nothing except that, Mr.
      Siward; nor, it appears, do you, for you were drunk at the time, and you
      have admitted it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have asked you,&rdquo; said Siward, rising, and very grave, &ldquo;I have asked you
      to do the right thing. Are you going to do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that a threat?&rdquo; inquired Quarrier, showing the edges of his well-kept
      teeth. &ldquo;Is this intimidation, Mr. Siward? Do I understand that you are
      proposing to bespatter others with scandal unless I am frightened into
      going to the governors with the flimsy excuse you attempt to offer me? In
      other words, Mr. Siward, are you bent on making me pay for what you
      believe you know of my private life? Is it really intimidation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And still Siward stared into his half-veiled, sneering eyes, speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one name used for this kind of thing,&rdquo; added Quarrier,
      taking a quick involuntary step backward to the door as the blaze of fury
      broke out in Siward's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! Quarrier,&rdquo; whispered Siward with dry lips, &ldquo;what a cur you are!
      What a cur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And long after Quarrier had passed the door and disappeared in the
      corridor, Siward stood there, frozen motionless under the icy waves of
      rage that swept him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never before had an enemy worth the name; he knew he had one now.
      He had never before hated; he now understood something of that, too. The
      purely physical craving to take this man and crush him into eternal
      quiescence had given place to a more terrible mental desire to punish. His
      brain surged and surged under the first flood of a mortal hatred. That the
      hatred was sterile made it the more intense, and, blinded by it, he stood
      there or paced the room minute after minute, hearing nothing but the wild
      clamour in his brain, seeing nothing but the smooth, expressionless face
      of the man whom he could not reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward midnight, seated in his chair by the window, a deathly lassitude
      weighing his heart, he heard the steps of people on the stairway, the
      click of the ascending elevator, gay voices calling good night, a ripple
      of laughter, the silken swish of skirts in the corridor, doors opening and
      closing; then silence creeping throughout the house on the receding heels
      of departure&mdash;a stillness that settled like a mist through hall and
      corridor, accented for a few moments by distant sounds, then absolute,
      echoless silence. And for a long while he sat there listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cool wind from the ocean blew his curtains far into the room, where
      they bellied out, fluttering, floating, subsiding, only to rise again in
      the freshening breeze. He sat watching their silken convolutions,
      stupidly, for a while, then rose and closed his window, and raised the
      window on the south for purposes of air.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he turned to adjust his transom, something white thrust under the door
      caught his eye, and he walked over and drew it across the sill. It was a
      sealed note. He opened it, reading it as he walked back to the drop-light
      burning beside his bed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not mean to say good-bye? Because it is to be good-bye for a
      long, long time&mdash;for all our lives&mdash;as long as we live&mdash;as
      long as the world lasts, and longer.... Good-bye&mdash;unless you care to
      say it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood studying the note for a while; presently, lighting a match, he
      set fire to it and carried it blazing to the grate and flung it in,
      watching the blackened ashes curl up, glow, whiten, and fall in flakes to
      the hearth. Then he went out into the corridor, and traversed the hall to
      the passage which led to the bay-window. There was nobody there. The stars
      looked in on him, twinkling with a frosty light; beneath, the shadowy
      fronds of palms traced a pale pattern on the glass roof of the swimming
      pool. He waited a moment, turned, retraced his steps to his own door and
      stood listening. Then, moving swiftly, he walked the length of the
      corridor, and, halting at her door, knocked once.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment the door swung open. He stepped forward into the room,
      closing the door behind him, and confronted the tall girl standing there
      silhouetted against the lamp behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are insane to do this!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I let you in for fear you'd
      knock again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to the bay-window,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went too late. I was there an hour ago. I waited. Do you know what
      time it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to the bay-window,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you fear me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know it is nearly three o'clock?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;And you leave at
      six.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we say good-bye here?&rdquo; he asked coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I dare not go out. And you&mdash;do you know the chances we
      are running? You must be perfectly mad to come to my room. Do you think
      anybody could have seen&mdash;heard you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Good night.&rdquo; He offered his hand; she laid both of hers in it. He
      could scarcely distinguish her features where she stood dark against the
      brilliant light behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he whispered, kissing her hands where they lay in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo; Her fingers closed convulsively, retaining his hands. &ldquo;I hope&mdash;I
      think that&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo; Her head was drooping; she could not control
      her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Sylvia,&rdquo; he said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite useless, she could not speak; and when he took her in his
      arms she clung to him, quivering; and he kissed the wet lashes, and the
      hot, trembling lips, and the smooth little hands crushed to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a year yet,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Dear, take me by force before it ends.
      I&mdash;I simply cannot endure this. I told you to take me&mdash;to tear
      me from myself. Will you do it? I will love you&mdash;truly, truly! Oh, my
      darling, my darling! Don't&mdash;don't give me up! Can't you do something
      for us? Can't you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come with me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden sound broke out in the night&mdash;the distant pealing of the
      lodge-gate bell. Startled, she shrank back; somebody in the adjoining room
      had sprung to the floor and was opening the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she motioned with whitening lips. &ldquo;Quick! oh, quick, before
      you are seen! Grace may come! I&mdash;I beg of you to go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he stepped into the corridor he heard, below, a sound at the great
      door, and the stirring of the night watchman on post. At his own door he
      turned, listening to the movement and whispering. Ferrall, in
      dressing-gown and slippers, stepped into the corridor; below, the chains
      were rattling as the wicket swung open. There was a brief parley at the
      door, sounds of retreating steps on the gravel outside, sounds of
      approaching steps on the stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that? A telegram?&rdquo; said Ferrall sharply. &ldquo;Here, give it to me....
      Wait! It isn't for me. It's for Mr Siward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward, standing at his open door, swayed slightly. A thrill of pure fear
      struck him through and through. He laid one hand on the door to steady
      himself, and stepped forward as Ferrall came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! You're awake, Stephen. Here's a telegram.&rdquo; He extended his hand.
      Siward took the yellow envelope, fumbled it, tore it open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; whispered Ferrall; &ldquo;is it bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Siward's glazed eyes stared and stared at the scrawled and inky
      message:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOUR MOTHER IS VERY ILL. COME AT ONCE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The signature was the name of their family physician, Grisby.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII CONFIDENCES
    </h2>
    <p>
      By January the complex social mechanism of the metropolis was whirling
      smoothly again; the last ultra-fashionable December lingerer had returned
      from the country; those of the same caste outward bound for a Southern or
      exotic winter had departed; and the glittering machine, every part
      assembled, refurbished, repolished, and connected, having been given
      preliminary speed-tests at the horse show, and a tuning up at the opera,
      was now running under full velocity; and its steady, subdued whir
      quickened the clattering pulse of the city, keying it to a sublimely
      syncopated ragtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commercial reaction from the chaos of the holidays had become a
      carnival of recovery; shop windows grew brighter and gayer than ever,
      bursting into gaudy winter florescence; the main arteries of the town
      roared prosperity; cross streets were packed; Fifth Avenue, almost
      impassible in the morning, choked up after three o'clock; and all the
      afternoon through, and late into the night, mounted police of the traffic
      squad, adrift in the tide of carriages, stemmed the flashing currents
      pouring north and south from the white marble arch to the gilded bronze
      battle-horse and its rider on guard at the portals of the richest quarter
      of the wealthiest city in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, that winter, snow had fallen only twice, lasting but a day or two
      each time; street and avenue remained bone dry where the white-uniformed
      cleaning squads worked amid clouds of dust; and all day long the flinty
      asphalt echoed the rattling slap of horses' feet; all day long the big,
      shining motor-cars sped up town and down town, droning their distant
      warnings. It was an open winter in New York, and, financially, a
      prosperous one; and that meant a brilliant social season. Like a set piece
      of fireworks, with its interdependent parts taking fire in turn, function
      after function, spectacle after spectacle, glittered, fizzed, and was
      extinguished, only to give place to newer and more splendid spectacles;
      separate circles, sets, and groups belonging to the social solar system
      whizzed, revolved, rotated, with edifying effects on everybody concerned,
      unconcerned, and not at all concerned; and at intervals, when for a moment
      or two something hung fire, the twinkle of similar spectacles sputtering
      away in distant cities beyond the horizon was faintly reflected in the
      social sky above the incandescent metropolis. For the whole nation was
      footing it, heel and toe, to the echoes of strains borne on the winds from
      the social capital of the republic; and the social arbiter at Bird Centre
      was more of a facsimile of his New York confrÃ¨re than that confrÃ¨re could
      ever dream of even in the most realistic of nightmares.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three phenomena particularly characterised that metropolitan winter: the
      reckless rage for private gambling through the mediums of bridge and
      roulette; the incorporation of a company known as The Inter-County
      Electric Company, capitalised at a figure calculated to disturb nobody,
      and, so far, without any avowed specific policy other than that which
      served to decorate a portion of its charter which otherwise might have
      remained ornately and comparatively blank; the third phenomenon was the
      retirement from active affairs of Stanley S. Quarrier, the father of
      Howard Quarrier, and the election of the son to the presidency of the
      great Algonquin Loan and Trust Company, with its network system of
      dependent, subsidiary, and allied corporations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day that the newspapers gave this interesting information to the
      Western world, Leroy Mortimer, on being bluntly notified that he had
      overdrawn his account with the Algonquin Loan and Trust, began telephoning
      in every direction until he located Beverly Plank at the Saddle Club&mdash;an
      organisation of wealthy men, and sufficiently exclusive not to compromise
      Plank's possible chances for something better; in fact, the Saddle Club,
      into which Leroy Mortimer had already managed to pilot him, was one riser
      and tread upward on the stair he was climbing, though it was more of a
      lobby for other clubs than a club in itself. To be seen there was,
      perhaps, rather to a man's advantage, if he did not loaf there in the
      evenings or use it too frequently. As Plank carefully avoided doing
      either, Mortimer was fortunate in finding him there; and he crawled out of
      his hansom, saying that the desk clerk would pay, and entered the
      reading-room, where Plank sat writing a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beverly Plank had grown stouter since he had returned to town from Black
      Fells; but the increase of weight was evenly distributed over his six feet
      odd, which made him only a trifle more ponderous and not abdominally fat.
      But Mortimer had become enormous; rolls of flesh crowded his mottled
      ear-lobes outward and bulged above his collar; cushions of it padded the
      backs of his hands and fingers; shaving left his heavy, distended face
      congested and unpleasantly shiny. But he was as minutely groomed as ever,
      and he wore that satiated air of prosperity which had always been one of
      his most important assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The social campaign inaugurated by Leila Mortimer in behalf of Beverly
      Plank had, so far, received no serious reverses. His box at the horse
      show, of course, produced merely negative results; his box at the opera
      might mean something some day. His name was up at the Lenox and the
      Patroons; he had endowed a ward in the new pavilion of St. Berold's
      Hospital; he had presented a fine Gainsborough&mdash;The Countess of Wythe&mdash;to
      the Metropolitan Museum; and it was rumoured that he had consulted several
      bishops concerning a new chapel for that huge bastion of the citadel of
      Faith looming above the metropolitan wilderness in the north.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, so good. If, as yet, he had not been permitted to go where he
      wanted to go, he at least had been instructed where not to go and what not
      to do; and he was as docile as he was dogged, understanding how much
      longer it takes to shuffle in by way of the mews and the back door than to
      sit on the front steps and wait politely for somebody to unchain the front
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile he was doggedly docile; his huge house, facing the wintry park
      midway between the squat palaces of the wealthy pioneers and the outer
      hundreds, remained magnificently empty save for certain afternoon
      conferences of very solemn men, fellow directors and associates in
      business and financial matters&mdash;save for the periodical presence of
      the Mortimers: a mansion immense and shadowy, haunted by relays of
      yawning, livened servants, half stupefied under the vast silence of the
      twilit splendour. He was patient, not only because he was told to be, but
      also because he had nothing better to do. Society stared at him as blankly
      as the Mountain confronted Mahomet. But the stubborn patience of the man
      was itself a strain on the Mountain; he was aware of that, and he waited
      for it to come to him. As yet, however, he could detect no symptoms of
      mobility in the Mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things are moving all the same,&rdquo; said Mortimer, as he entered the reading
      room of the Saddle Club. &ldquo;Quarrier and Belwether have listened a damned
      sight more respectfully to me since they read that column about you and
      the bishops and that chapel business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank turned his heavy head with a disturbed glance around the room; for
      he always dreaded Mortimer's indiscretions of speech&mdash;was afraid of
      his cynical frankness in the presence of others; even shrank from the
      brutal bonhomie of the man when alone with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you be careful?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there was a man here a moment ago.&rdquo; He
      picked up his unfinished letter, folded and pocketed it, touched an
      electric bell, and when a servant came, &ldquo;Take Mr. Mortimer's order,&rdquo; he
      said, supporting his massive head on his huge hands and resting his elbow
      on the writing-desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got to cut out this morning bracer,&rdquo; said Mortimer, eyeing the
      servant with indecision; but he gave his order nevertheless, and later
      accepted a cigar; and when the servant had returned and again retired, he
      half emptied his tall glass, refilled it with mineral water, and, settling
      back in the padded arm-chair, said: &ldquo;If I manage this thing as it ought to
      be managed, you'll go through by April. What do you think of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank's phlegmatic features flushed. &ldquo;I'm more obliged to you than I can
      say,&rdquo; he began, but Mortimer silenced him with a gesture: &ldquo;Don't
      interrupt. I'm going to put you through The Patroons Club by April. That's
      thirty yards through the centre; d'ye see, you dunderheaded Dutchman? It's
      solid gain, and it's our ball. The Lenox will take longer; they're a
      'holier-than-thou' bunch of nincompoops, and it always horrifies them to
      have any man elected, no matter who he is. They'd rather die of dry rot
      than elect anybody; it shocks them to think that any man could have the
      presumption to be presented. They require the spectacle of fasting and
      prayer&mdash;a view of a candidate seated in sackcloth and ashes in outer
      darkness. You've got to wait for the Lenox, Plank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am waiting,&rdquo; said Plank, squaring his massive jaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got to,&rdquo; growled Mortimer, emptying his glass aggressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank looked out of the window, his shrewd blue eyes closing in
      retrospection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; continued Mortimer thickly; &ldquo;the Kemp Ferralls are
      disposed to be decent. I don't mean in asking you to meet some
      intellectual second-raters, but in doing it handsomely. I don't know
      whether it's time yet,&rdquo; he added, with a sidelong glance at Plank's stolid
      face; &ldquo;I don't want to push the mourners too hard... Well, I'll see about
      it... And if it's the thing to do, and the time to do it&rdquo;&mdash;he turned
      on Plank with his boisterous and misleading laugh and clapped him on the
      shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;it will be done, as sure as snobs are snobs; and that's
      the surest thing you ever bet on. Here's to them!&rdquo; and he emptied his
      glass and fell back into his chair, wheezing and sucking at his unlighted
      cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to say,&rdquo; began Plank, speaking the more slowly because he was
      deeply in earnest, &ldquo;that all this you are doing for me is very handsome of
      you, Mortimer. I'd like to say&mdash;to convey to you something of how I
      feel about the way you and Mrs. Mortimer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Leila has done it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Mortimer is very kind, and you have been so, too. I&mdash;I wish
      there was something&mdash;some way to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what?&rdquo; asked Mortimer so bluntly that Plank flushed up and stammered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be&mdash;to do a&mdash;to show my gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? You're scarcely in a position to do anything for us,&rdquo; said Mortimer,
      brutally staring him out of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Plank, the painful flush deepening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer, fussing and growling over his cigar, was nevertheless stealthily
      intent on the game which had so long absorbed him. His wits, clogged,
      dulled by excesses, were now aroused to a sort of gross activity through
      the menace of necessity. At last Plank had given him an opening. He
      recognised his chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's one thing,&rdquo; he said deliberately, &ldquo;that I won't stand for, and
      that's any vulgar misconception on your part of my friendship for you. Do
      you follow me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't misunderstand it,&rdquo; protested Plank, angry and astonished; &ldquo;I
      don't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;As though,&rdquo; continued Mortimer menacingly, &ldquo;I were one of those
      needy social tipsters, one of those shabby, pandering touts who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven's sake, Mortimer, don't talk like that! I had no intention&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;One of those contemptible, parasitic leeches,&rdquo; persisted Mortimer,
      getting redder and hoarser, &ldquo;who live on men like you. Confound you,
      Plank, what the devil do you mean by it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mortimer, are you crazy, to talk to me like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not, but you must be! I've a mind to drop the whole cursed
      business! I've every inclination to drop it! If you haven't horse-sense
      enough&mdash;if you haven't innate delicacy sufficient to keep you from
      making such a break&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't! It wasn't a break, Mortimer. I wouldn't have hurt you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did hurt me! How can I feel the same again? I never imagined you
      thought I was that sort of a social mercenary. Why, so little did I dream
      that you looked on our friendship in that light that I was&mdash;on my
      word of honour!&mdash;I was just now on the point of asking you for three
      or four thousand, to carry me to the month's end and square my bridge
      balance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mortimer, you must take it! You are a fool to think I meant anything by
      saying I wanted to show my gratitude. Look here; be decent and fair with
      me. I wouldn't offer you an affront&mdash;would I?&mdash;even if I were a
      cad. I wouldn't do it now, just when you're getting things into shape for
      me. I'm not a fool, anyway. This is in deadly earnest, I tell you,
      Mortimer, and I'm getting angry about it. You've got to show your
      confidence in me; you've got to take what you want from me, as you would
      from any friend. I resent your failure to do it now, as though you drew a
      line between me and your intimates. If you're really my friend, show it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. A curious and unaccustomed sensation had silenced
      Mortimer, something almost akin to shame. It astonished him a little. He
      did not quite understand why, in the very moment of success over this
      stolid, shrewd young man and his thrifty Dutch instincts, he should feel
      uncomfortable. Were not his services worth something? Had he not earned at
      least the right to borrow from this rich man who could afford to pay for
      what was done for him? Why should he feel ashamed? He had not been
      treacherous; he really liked the fellow. Why shouldn't he take his money?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, old man,&rdquo; said Plank, extending a huge highly coloured hand,
      &ldquo;is all square between us now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; muttered Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Plank would not relinquish his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tell me how to draw that cheque! Great Heaven, Mortimer, what is
      friendship, anyhow, if it doesn't include little matters like this&mdash;little
      misunderstandings like this? I'm the man to be sensitive, not you. You
      have been very good to me, Mortimer. I could almost wish you in a position
      where the only thing I possess might square something of my debt to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later, while he was filling in the cheque, a dusty youth in
      riding clothes and spurs came in and found a seat by one of the windows,
      into which he dropped, and then looked about him for a servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Fleetwood!&rdquo; said Mortimer, glancing over his shoulder to see whose
      spurs were ringing on the polished floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleetwood saluted amiably with his riding-crop; including Plank, whom he
      did not know, in a more formal salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you join us?&rdquo; asked Mortimer, taking the cheque which Plank offered
      and carelessly pocketing it without even a nod of thanks. &ldquo;You know
      Beverly Plank, of course? What! I thought everybody knew Beverly Plank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fleetwood and Mr. Plank shook hands and resumed their seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ripping weather!&rdquo; observed Fleetwood, replacing his hat and rebuttoning
      the glove which he had removed to shake hands with Plank. &ldquo;Lot of jolly
      people out this morning. I say, Mortimer, do you want that roan hunter of
      mine you looked over? I mean King Dermid, because Marion Page wants him,
      if you don't. She was out this morning, and she spoke of it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer, lifting a replenished glass, shook his head, and drank thirstily
      in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saw you at Westbury, I think,&rdquo; said Fleetwood politely to Plank, as the
      two lifted their glasses to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hunted there for a day or two,&rdquo; replied Plank, modestly. &ldquo;If it's that
      big Irish thoroughbred you were riding that you want to sell I'd like a
      look in, if Miss Page doesn't fancy him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fleetwood laughed, and glanced amusedly at Plank over his glass. &ldquo;It isn't
      that horse, Mr. Plank. That's Drumceit, Stephen Siward's famous horse.&rdquo; He
      interrupted himself to exchange greetings with several men who came into
      the room rather noisily, their spurs resounding across the oaken floor.
      One of them, Tom O'Hara, joined them, slamming his crop on the desk beside
      Plank and spreading himself over an arm-chair, from the seat of which he
      forcibly removed Mortimer's feet without excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink? Of course I want a drink!&rdquo; he replied irritably to Fleetwood&mdash;&ldquo;one,
      three, ten, several! Billy, whose weasel-bellied pinto was that you were
      kicking your heels into in the park? Some of the squadron men asked me&mdash;the
      major. Oh, beg pardon! Didn't know you were trying to stick Mortimer with
      him. He might do for the troop ambulance, inside!... What? Oh, yes; met
      Mr. Blank&mdash;I mean Mr. Plank&mdash;at Shotover, I think. How d'ye do?
      Had the pleasure of potting your tame pheasants. Rotten sport, you know.
      What do you do it for, Mr. Blank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you come for, if it's rotten sport?&rdquo; asked Plank so simply that
      it took O'Hara a moment to realise he had been snubbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean to be offensive,&rdquo; he drawled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you can't help it,&rdquo; said Plank very gently; &ldquo;some people can't,
      you know.&rdquo; And there was another silence, broken by Mortimer, whose entire
      hulk was tingling with a mixture of surprise and amusement over his
      protÃ©gÃ©'s developing ability to take care of himself. &ldquo;Did you say that
      Stephen Siward is in Westbury, Billy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he's in town,&rdquo; replied Fleetwood. &ldquo;I took his horses up to hunt with.
      He isn't hunting, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know. Nobody ever sees him anywhere,&rdquo; said Mortimer. &ldquo;I guess
      his mother's death cut him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fleetwood lifted his empty glass and gently shook the ice in it. &ldquo;That,
      and&mdash;the other business&mdash;is enough to cut any man up, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the action of the Lenox Club?&rdquo; asked Plank seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He's resigned from this club, too, I hear. Somebody told me that he
      has made a clean sweep of all his clubs. That's foolish. A man may be an
      ass to join too many clubs but he's always a fool to resign from any of
      'em. You ask the weatherwise what resigning from a club forecasts. It's
      the first ominous sign in a young man's career.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the second sign?&rdquo; asked O'Hara, with a yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squadron talk; and you're full of it,&rdquo; retorted Fleetwood&mdash;&ldquo;'I said
      to the major,' and 'The captain told the chief trumpeter'&mdash;all that
      sort of thing&mdash;and those Porto Rico spurs of yours, and the
      ewe-necked glyptosaurus you block the bridle-path with every morning.
      You're an awful nuisance, Tom, if anybody should ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under cover of a rapid-fire exchange of pleasantries between Fleetwood and
      O'Hara, Plank turned to Mortimer, hesitating:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather liked Siward when I met him at Shotover,&rdquo; he ventured. &ldquo;I'm very
      sorry he's down and out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He drinks,&rdquo; shrugged Mortimer, diluting his mineral water with Irish
      whisky. &ldquo;He can't let it alone; he's like all the Siwards. I could have
      told you that the first time I ever saw him. We all told him to cut it
      out, because he was sure to do some damfool thing if he didn't. He's done
      it, and his clubs have cut him out. It's his own funeral.... Well, here's
      to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut who out?&rdquo; asked Fleetwood, ignoring O'Hara's parting shot concerning
      the decadence of the Fleetwood stables and their owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen Siward. I always said that he was sure, sooner or later, to land
      in the family ditch. He has a right to, of course; the gutter is public
      property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a damned sad thing,&rdquo; said Fleetwood slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause Plank said: &ldquo;I think so, too.... I don't know him very
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may know him better now,&rdquo; said O'Hara insolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank reddened, and, after a moment: &ldquo;I should be glad to, if he cares to
      know me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mortimer doesn't care for him, but he's an awfully good fellow, all the
      same,&rdquo; said Fleetwood, turning to Plank; &ldquo;he's been an ass, but who
      hasn't? I like him tremendously, and I feel very bad over the mess he made
      of it after that crazy dinner I gave in my rooms. What? You hadn't heard
      of it? Why man, it's the talk of the clubs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that is why I haven't heard,&rdquo; said Plank simply; &ldquo;my club-life
      is still in the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Fleetwood with an involuntary stare, surprised, a trifle
      uncomfortable, yet somehow liking Plank, and not understanding why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not in anything, you see; I'm only up for the Patroons and the
      Lenox,&rdquo; added Plank gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Certainly. Er&mdash;hope you'll make 'em; hope to see you there
      soon. Er&mdash;I see by the papers you've been jollying the clergy, Mr.
      Plank. Awfully handsome of you, all that chapel business. I say: I've a
      cousin&mdash;er&mdash;young architect; Beaux Arts, and all that&mdash;just
      over. I'd awfully like to have him given a chance at that competition;
      invited to try, you see. I don't suppose it could be managed, now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to have me ask the bishops?&rdquo; inquired Plank, naively
      shrewd. And the conversation became very cordial between the two, which
      Mortimer observed, keeping one ironical eye on Plank, while he continued a
      desultory discussion with O'Hara concerning a very private dinner which
      somebody told somebody that somebody had given to Quarrier and the
      Inter-County Electric people; which, if true, plainly indicated who was
      financing the Inter-County scheme, and why Amalgamated stock had tumbled
      again yesterday, and what might be looked for from the Algonquin Trust
      Company's president.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amalgamated Electric doesn't seem to like it a little bit,&rdquo; said O'Hara.
      &ldquo;Ferrall, Belwether, and Siward are in it up to their necks; and if
      Quarrier is really the god in the machine, and if he really is doing
      stunts with Amalgamated Electric, and is also mixing feet with the
      Inter-County crowd, why, he is virtually paralleling his own road; and
      why, in the name of common sense, is he doing that? He'll kill it; that's
      what he'll do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can afford to kill it,&rdquo; observed Mortimer, punching the electric
      button and making a significant gesture toward his empty glass as the
      servant entered; &ldquo;a man like Quarrier can afford to kill anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but why kill Amalgamated Electric? Why not merge? Why, it's a crazy
      thing to do, it's a devil of a thing to do, to parallel your own line!&rdquo;
       insisted O'Hara. &ldquo;That is dirty work. People don't do such things these
      days. Nobody tears up dollar bills for the pleasure of tearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody knows what Quarrier will do,&rdquo; muttered Mortimer, who had tried
      hard enough to find out when the first ominous rumours arose concerning
      Amalgamated, and the first fractional declines left the street speechless
      and stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Hara sat frowning, and fingering his glass. &ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;a little cold logic shows us that Quarrier isn't in it at all. No
      sane man would ruin his own enterprise, when there is no need to. His
      people are openly supporting Amalgamated and hammering Inter-County; and,
      besides, there's Ferrall in it, and Mrs. Ferrall is Quarrier's cousin; and
      there's Belwether in it, and Quarrier is engaged to marry Sylvia Landis,
      who is Belwether's niece. It's a scrap with Harrington's crowd, and the
      wheels inside of wheels are like Chinese boxes. Who knows what it means?
      Only it's plain that Amalgamated is safe, if Quarrier wants it to be. And
      unless he does he's crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer puffed stolidly at his cigar until the smoke got into his eyes
      and inflamed them. He sat for a while, wiping his puffy eyelids with his
      handkerchief; then, squinting sideways at Plank, and seeing him still
      occupied with Fleetwood, turned bluntly on O'Hara:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here: what do you mean by being nasty to Plank?&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I'm
      backing him. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is curious,&rdquo; mused O'Hara coolly, &ldquo;how much of a cad a fairly decent
      man can be when he's out of temper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Plank, or me?&rdquo; demanded Mortimer, darkening angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I mean myself. I'm not that way usually. I took him for a bounder,
      and he's caught me with the goods on. I've been thinking that the men who
      bother with such questions are usually open to suspicion themselves. Watch
      me do the civil, now. I'm ashamed of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment. Will you be civil enough to do something for him at the
      Patroons? That will mean something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he up? Yes, I will;&rdquo; and, turning in his chair, he said to Plank:
      &ldquo;Awfully sorry I acted like a bounder just now, after having accepted your
      hospitality at the Fells. I did mean to be offensive, and I'm sorry for
      that, too. Hope you'll overlook it, and be friendly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank's face took on the dark-red hue of embarrassment; he looked
      questioningly at Mortimer, whose visage remained non-committal, then
      directly at O'Hara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be very glad to be friends with you,&rdquo; he said with an ingenuous
      dignity that surprised Mortimer. It was only the native simplicity of the
      man, veneered and polished by constant contact with Mrs. Mortimer, and now
      showing to advantage in the grain. And it gratified Mortimer, because he
      saw that it was going to make many matters much easier for himself and his
      protÃ©gÃ©.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall glasses were filled and drained again before they departed to the
      cold plunge and dressing-rooms above, whence presently they emerged in
      street garb to drive down town and lunch together at the Lenox Club, Plank
      as Fleetwood's guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer, very heavy and inert after luncheon, wedged himself into a great
      stuffed arm-chair by the window, where he alternately nodded over his
      coffee and wheezed in his breathing, and leered out at Fifth Avenue from
      half-closed, puffy eyes. And there he was due to sit, sodden and replete,
      until the fashionable equipages began to flash past. He'd probably see his
      wife driving with Mrs. Ferrall or with Miss Caithness, or perhaps with
      some doddering caryatid of the social structure; and he'd sit there,
      leering with gummy eyes out of the club windows, while servants in silent
      processional replenished his glass from time to time, until in the early
      night the trim little shopgirls flocked out into the highways in
      gossiping, fluttering coveys, trotting away across the illuminated
      asphalt, north and south to their thousand dingy destinations. And after
      they had gone he would probably arouse himself to read the evening paper,
      or perhaps gossip with Major Belwether and other white-haired familiars,
      or perhaps doze until it was time to summon a cab and go home to dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon, however, having O'Hara and Fleetwood to give him
      countenance, he managed to arouse himself long enough to make Plank known
      personally to several of the governors of the club and to a dozen members,
      then left him to his fate. Whence, presently, Fleetwood and O'Hara
      extracted him&mdash;fate at that moment being personified by a garrulous
      old gentleman, one Peter Caithness, who divided with Major Belwether the
      distinction of being the club bore&mdash;and together they piloted him to
      the billiard room, where he beat them handily for a dollar a point at
      everything they suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You play almost as pretty a game as Stephen Siward used to play,&rdquo; said
      O'Hara cordially. &ldquo;You've something of his cue movement&mdash;something of
      his infernal facility and touch. Hasn't he, Fleetwood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish Siward were back here,&rdquo; said Fleetwood thoughtfully, returning his
      cue to his own rack. &ldquo;I wonder what he does with himself&mdash;where he
      keeps himself all the while? What the devil is there for a man to do, if
      he doesn't do anything? He's not going out anywhere since his mother's
      death; he has no clubs to go to, I understand. What does he do&mdash;go to
      his office and come back, and sit in that shabby old brick house all day
      and blink at the bum portraits of his bum and distinguished ancestors? Do
      you know what he does with himself?&rdquo; to O'Hara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't even know where he lives,&rdquo; observed O'Hara, resuming his coat.
      &ldquo;He's given up his rooms, I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Don't know the old Siward house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! does he live there now? Of course; I forgot about his mother. He had
      apartments last year, you remember. He gave dinners&mdash;corkers they
      were. I went to one&mdash;like that last one you gave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I'd never given it,&rdquo; said Fleetwood gloomily. &ldquo;If I hadn't, he'd
      be a member here still.... What do you suppose induced him to take that
      little gin-drinking cat to the Patroons? Why, man, it wasn't even an
      undergraduate's trick! it was the act of a lunatic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a while they talked of Siward, and of his unfortunate story and the
      pity of it; and when the two men ceased,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Plank mildly, &ldquo;I don't believe he ever did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O'Hara looked up surprised, then shrugged. &ldquo;Unfortunately he doesn't deny
      it, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard,&rdquo; said Fleetwood, lighting a cigarette, &ldquo;that he did deny it;
      that he said, no matter what his condition was, he couldn't have done it.
      If he had been sober, the governors would have been bound to take his word
      of honour. But he couldn't give that, you see. And after they pointed out
      to him that he had been in no condition to know exactly what he did do, he
      shut up.... And they dropped him; and he's falling yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe that sort of a man ever would do that sort of thing,&rdquo;
       repeated Plank obstinately, his Delft-blue eyes partly closing, so that
      all the Dutch shrewdness and stubbornness in his face disturbed its highly
      coloured placidity. And he walked away toward the wash-room to cleanse his
      ponderous pink hands of chalk-dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what's the matter with Plank,&rdquo; observed O'Hara to Fleetwood as
      Plank disappeared. &ldquo;It isn't that he's a bounder; but he doesn't know
      things; he doesn't know enough, for instance, to wait until he's a member
      of a club before he criticises the judgment of its governors. Yet you
      can't help tolerating the fellow. I think I'll write a letter for him, or
      put down my name. What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be all right,&rdquo; said Fleetwood. &ldquo;He'll need all the support he
      can get, with Leroy Mortimer as his sponsor.... Wasn't Mortimer rather
      nasty about Siward though, in his rÃ´le of the alcoholic prophet? Whew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Siward never had any use for Mortimer,&rdquo; observed O'Hara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll bet you never heard him say so,&rdquo; returned Fleetwood. &ldquo;You know
      Stephen Siward's way; he never said anything unpleasant about any man. I
      wish I didn't either, but I do. So do you. So do most men.... Lord! I wish
      Siward were back here. He was a good deal of a man, after all, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were unconsciously using the past tense in discussing Siward, as
      though he were dead, either physically or socially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In one way he was always a singularly decent man,&rdquo; mused O'Hara, walking
      toward the great marble vestibule and buttoning his overcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How exactly do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, about women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it, too. If he did take that Vyse girl into the Patroons, it
      was his limit with her&mdash;and, I believe his limit with any woman. He
      was absurdly decent that way; he was indeed. And now look at the
      reputation he has! Isn't it funny? isn't it, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of an effect do you suppose all this business is going to have
      on Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's had one effect already,&rdquo; replied Fleetwood, as Plank came up, ready
      for the street. &ldquo;Ferrall says he looks sick, and Belwether says he's going
      to the devil; but that's the sort of thing the major is likely to say. By
      the way, wasn't there something between that pretty Landis girl and
      Siward? Somebody&mdash;some damned gossiping somebody&mdash;talked about
      it somewhere, recently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe that, either,&rdquo; said Plank, in his heavy, measured,
      passionless voice, as they descended the steps of the white portico and
      looked around for a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for me, I've got to hustle,&rdquo; observed O'Hara, glancing at his watch.
      &ldquo;I'm due to shine at a function about five. Are you coming up-town either
      of you fellows? I'll give you a lift as far as Seventy-second Street,
      Plank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you what we'll do,&rdquo; said Fleetwood, impulsively, turning to Plank:
      &ldquo;We'll drive down town, you and I, and we'll look up poor old Siward!
      Shall we? He's probably all alone in that God-forsaken red brick family
      tomb! Shall we? How about it, Plank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O'Hara turned impatiently on his heel with a gesture of adieu, climbed
      into his electric hansom, and went buzzing away up the avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to, but I don't think I know Mr. Siward well enough to do that,&rdquo;
       said Plank diffidently. He hesitated, colouring up. &ldquo;He might
      misunderstand my going with you&mdash;as a liberty&mdash;which perhaps I
      might not have ventured on had he been less&mdash;less unfortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Fleetwood warmed toward the ruddy, ponderous young man beside him.
      &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are going as a friend of mine&mdash;if you care
      to look at it that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Plank; &ldquo;I should be very glad to go in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Siward house was old only in the comparative Manhattan meaning of the
      word; for in New York nothing is really very old, except the faces of the
      young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decades ago it had been considered a big house, and it was still so spoken
      of&mdash;a solid, dingy, red brick structure, cubical in proportions,
      surmounted by heavy chimneys, the depth of its sunken windows hinting of
      the thickness of wall and foundation. Window-curtains of obsolete pattern,
      all alike, and all drawn, masked the blank panes. Three massive
      wistaria-vines, the gnarled stems as thick as tree-trunks, crawled upward
      to the roof, dividing the faÃ§ade equally, and furnishing some relief to
      its flatness, otherwise unbroken except by the deep reveals of window and
      door. Two huge and unsymmetrical catalpa trees stood sentinels before it,
      dividing curb from asphalt; and from the centres of the shrivelled, brown
      grass-plots flanking the stoop under the basement windows two aged
      Rose-of-Sharon trees bristled naked to the height of the white marble
      capitals of the flaking pillars supporting the stained portico.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old New York house, in the New York sense. Old in another sense, too,
      where in a rapid land Time outstrips itself, painting, with the antiquity
      of centuries, the stone and mortar which were new scarce ten years since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice old family mausoleum,&rdquo; commented Fleetwood, descending from the
      hansom, followed by Plank. The latter instinctively mounted the stoop on
      tiptoe, treading gingerly as one who ventures into precincts unknown but
      long respected; and as Fleetwood pulled the old-fashioned bell, Plank
      stole a glance over the faÃ§ade, where wisps of straw trailed from
      sparrows' nests, undisturbed, wedged between plinth and pillar; where,
      behind the lace pane-screens, shadowy edges of heavy curtains framed the
      obscurity; where the paint had blistered and peeled from the iron
      railings, and the marble pillars of the portico glimmered, scarred by
      frosts of winters long forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheerful monument,&rdquo; repeated Fleetwood with a sarcastic nod. Then the
      door was opened by a very old man wearing the black &ldquo;swallow-tail&rdquo; clothes
      and choker of an old-time butler, spotless, quite immaculate, but cut
      after a fashion no young man remembers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; said Fleetwood, entering, followed on tiptoe by Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, sir.&rdquo;... A pause; and in the unsteady voice of age: &ldquo;Mr.
      Fleetwood, sir.... Mr.&mdash;.&rdquo; A bow, and the dim eyes peering up at
      Plank, who stood fumbling for his card-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleetwood dropped both cards on the salver unsteadily extended. The butler
      ushered them into a dim room on the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Mr. Siward?&rdquo; asked Fleetwood, pausing on the threshold and
      dropping his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man hesitated, looking down, then still looking away from
      Fleetwood: &ldquo;Bravely, sir, bravely, Mr. Fleetwood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Siwards were always that,&rdquo; said the young man gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.... Thank you. Mr. Stephen&mdash;Mr. Siward,&rdquo; he corrected,
      quaintly, &ldquo;is indisposed, sir. It was a&mdash;a great shock to us all,
      sir!&rdquo; He bowed and turned away, holding his salver stiffly; and they heard
      him muttering under his breath, &ldquo;Bravely, sir, bravely. A&mdash;a great
      shock, sir!... Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fleetwood turned to Plank, who stood silent, staring through the fading
      light at the faded household gods of the house of Siward. The dim light
      touched the prisms of a crystal chandelier dulled by age, and edged the
      carved foliations of the marble mantel, above which loomed a tarnished
      mirror reflecting darkness. Fleetwood rose, drew a window-shade higher,
      and nodded toward several pictures; and Plank moved slowly from one to
      another, peering up at the dead Siwards in their crackled varnish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the real thing,&rdquo; observed Fleetwood cynically, &ldquo;all this Fourth
      Avenue antique business; dingy, cumbersome, depressing. Good God! I see
      myself standing it.... Look at that old grinny-bags in a pig-tail over
      there! To the cellar for his, if this were my house.... We've got some,
      too, in several rooms, and I never go into 'em. They're like a scene in a
      bum play, or like one of those Washington Square rat-holes, where artists
      eat Welsh-rabbits with dirty fingers. Ugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; said Plank, under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleetwood stared, then shrugged, and returned to the window to watch a
      brand-new French motor-car drawn up before a modern mansion across the
      avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butler returned presently, saying that Mr. Siward was at home and
      would receive them in the library above, as he was not yet able to pass up
      and down stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know he was as ill as that,&rdquo; muttered Fleetwood, as he and Plank
      followed the old man up the creaking stairway. But Gumble, the butler,
      said nothing in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Siward was sitting in an arm-chair by the window, one leg extended, his
      left foot, stiffly cased in bandages, resting on a footstool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Stephen!&rdquo; exclaimed Fleetwood, hastening forward, &ldquo;I didn't know you
      were laid up like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward offered his hand inquiringly; then his eyes turned toward Plank,
      who stood behind Fleetwood; and, slowly disengaging his hand from
      Fleetwood's sympathetic grip, he offered it to Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very kind of you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Gumble, Mr. Fleetwood prefers rye, for
      some inscrutable reason. Mr. Plank?&rdquo; His smile was a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't mind,&rdquo; said Plank, &ldquo;I should like to have some tea&mdash;that
      is, if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tea, Gumble, for two. We'll tipple in company, Mr. Plank,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;And
      the cigars are at your elbow, Billy,&rdquo; with another smile at Fleetwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the latter, after he had lighted his cigar, &ldquo;what is the
      matter, Stephen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward glanced at his stiffly extended foot. &ldquo;Nothing much.&rdquo; He reddened
      faintly, &ldquo;I slipped. It's only a twisted ankle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment or two the answer satisfied Fleetwood, then a sudden, curious
      flash of suspicion came into his eyes; he glanced sharply at Siward, who
      lowered his eyes, while the red tint in his hollow cheeks deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither spoke for a while. Plank sipped the tea which Wands, the second
      man, brought. Siward brooded over his cup, head bent. Fleetwood made more
      noise than necessary with his ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I miss you like hell!&rdquo; said Fleetwood musingly, measuring out the old rye
      from the quaint decanter. &ldquo;Why did you drop the Saddle Club, Stephen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not riding; I have no use for it,&rdquo; replied Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've cut out the Proscenium Club, too, and the Owl's Head, and the
      Trophy. It's a shame, Stephen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm tired of clubs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I won't,&rdquo; said Siward, smiling. &ldquo;Tell me what is happening&mdash;out
      there,&rdquo; he made a gesture toward the window; &ldquo;all the gossip the
      newspapers miss. I've talked Dr. Grisby to death; I've talked Gumble to
      death; I've read myself stupid. What's going on, Billy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Fleetwood sketched for him a gay cartoon of events, caricaturing
      various episodes in the social kaleidoscope which might interest him. He
      gossiped cynically, but without malice, about people they both knew, about
      engagements, marriages, and divorces, plans and ambitions; about those
      absent from the metropolis and the newcomers to be welcomed. He commented
      briefly on the opera, reviewed the newer plays at the theatres, touched on
      the now dormant gaiety which had made the season at nearby country clubs
      conspicuous; then drifted into the hunting field, gossiping pleasantly in
      the vernacular about horses and packs and drag-hunts and stables, and what
      people thought of the new English hounds of the trial pack, and how the
      new M. F. H., Maitland Gray, had managed to break so many bones at
      Southbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Politics were touched upon, and they spoke of the possibility of Ferrall
      going to the Assembly, the sport of boss-baiting having become fashionable
      among amateurs, and providing a new amusement for the idle rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      So city, State, and national issues were run through lightly, business
      conditions noticed, the stock market speculated upon; and presently
      conversation died out, with a yawn from Fleetwood as he looked into his
      empty glass at the last bit of ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't do that, Billy,&rdquo; smiled Siward. &ldquo;You haven't discoursed upon art,
      literature, and science yet, and you can't go until you've adjusted the
      affairs of the nation for the next twenty-four hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art?&rdquo; yawned Fleetwood. &ldquo;Oh, pictures? Don't like 'em. Nobody ever looks
      at 'em except dÃ©butantes, who do it out of deviltry, to floor a man at a
      dinner or a dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about literature?&rdquo; inquired Siward gravely. &ldquo;Anything doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing in it,&rdquo; replied Fleetwood more gravely still. &ldquo;It's another
      feminine bluff&mdash;like all that music talk they hand you after the
      opera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. And science?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spider Flynn is matched to meet Kid Holloway; is that what you mean,
      Stephen? Somebody tumbled out of an air-ship the other day; is that what
      you mean? And they're selling scientific jewelry on Broadway at a dollar a
      quart; is that what you want to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward rested his head on his hand with a smile. &ldquo;Yes, that's about what I
      wanted to know, Billy&mdash;all about the arts and sciences.... Much
      obliged. You needn't stay any longer, if you don't want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How soon will you be out?&rdquo; inquired Fleetwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out? I don't know. I shall try to drive to the office to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the devil did you resign from all your clubs? How can I see you if I
      don't come here?&rdquo; began Fleetwood impatiently. &ldquo;I know, of course, that
      you're not going anywhere, but a man always goes to his club. You don't
      look well, Stephen. You are too much alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward did not answer. His face and body had certainly grown thinner since
      Fleetwood had last seen him. Plank, too, had been shocked at the change in
      him&mdash;the dark, hard lines under the eyes; the pallor, the curious
      immobility of the man, save for his fingers, which were always restless,
      now moving in search of some small object to worry and turn over and over,
      now nervously settling into a grasp on the arm of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Amalgamated Electric?&rdquo; asked Fleetwood, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it's all right. Want to buy some?&rdquo; replied Siward, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank stirred in his chair ponderously. &ldquo;Somebody is kicking it to
      pieces,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody is trying to,&rdquo; smiled Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harrington,&rdquo; nodded Fleetwood. Siward nodded back. Plank was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; continued Fleetwood, tentatively, &ldquo;you people need not worry,
      with Howard Quarrier back of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nobody said anything for a while. Presently Siward's restless hands,
      moving in search of something, encountered a pencil lying on the table
      beside him, and he picked it up and began drawing initials and scrolls on
      the margin of a newspaper; and all the scrolls framed initials, and all
      the initials were the same, twining and twisting into endless variations
      of the letters S. L.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I must go to the office to-morrow,&rdquo; he repeated absently. &ldquo;I am
      better&mdash;in fact I am quite well, except for this sprain.&rdquo; He looked
      down at his bandaged foot, then his pencil moved listlessly again,
      continuing the endless variations on the two letters. It was plain that he
      was tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleetwood rose and made his adieux almost affectionately. Plank moved
      forward on tiptoe, bulky and noiseless; and Siward held out his hand,
      saying something amiably formal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to have me come again?&rdquo; asked Plank, red with
      embarrassment, yet so naively that at first Siward found no words to
      answer him; then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you care to come, Mr. Plank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward looked at him curiously, almost cautiously. His first impressions
      of the man had been summed up in one contemptuous word. Besides, barring
      that, what was there in common between himself and such a type as Plank?
      He had not even troubled himself to avoid him at Shotover; he had merely
      been aware of him when Plank spoke to him; never otherwise, except that
      afternoon beside the swimming pool, when he had made one of his rare
      criticisms on Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Plank had changed, perhaps Siward had; for he found nothing
      offensive in the bulky young man now&mdash;nothing particularly
      attractive, either, except for a certain simplicity, a certain direct
      candour in the heavy blue eyes which met his squarely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in for a cigar when you have a few moments idle,&rdquo; said Siward
      slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will give me great pleasure,&rdquo; said Plank, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was all. He followed Fleetwood down the stairs; Wands held their
      coats, and bowed them out into the falling shadows of the winter twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Siward, sitting beside his window, watched them enter their hansom and
      drive away up the avenue. A dull flush had settled over his cheeks; the
      aroma of spirits hung in the air, and he looked across the room at the
      decanter. Presently he drank some of his tea, but it was lukewarm, and he
      pushed the cup from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clatter of the cup brought the old butler, who toddled hither and
      thither, removing trays, pulling chairs into place, fussing and pattering
      about, until a maid came in noiselessly, bearing a lamp. She pulled down
      the shades, drew the sad-coloured curtains, went to the mantelpiece and
      peered at the clock, then brought a wineglass and a spoon to Siward, and
      measured the dose in silence. He swallowed it, shrugged, permitted her to
      change the position of his chair and footstool, and nodded thanks and
      dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gumble, are you there?&rdquo; he asked carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butler entered from the hallway. &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may leave that decanter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the old servant may have misunderstood, for he only bowed and ambled
      off downstairs with the decanter, either heedless or deaf to his master's
      sharp order to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while Siward sat there, eyes fixed, scowling into vacancy; then the
      old, listless, careworn expression returned; he rested one elbow on the
      window-sill, his worn cheek on his hand, and with the other hand fell to
      weaving initials with his pencil on the margin of the newspaper lying on
      the table beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamplight brought out sharply the physical change in him&mdash;the angular
      shadows flat under the cheek-bones, the hard, slightly swollen flesh in
      the bluish shadows around the eyes. The mark of the master-vice was there;
      its stamp in the swollen, worn-out hollows; its imprint in the fine lines
      at the corners of his mouth; its sign manual in the faintest relaxation of
      the under lip, which had not yet become a looseness.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the last of the Siwards had at last stepped into the highway which his
      doomed forebears had travelled before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gumble!&rdquo; he called irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quavering voice, an unsteady step, and the old man entered again. &ldquo;Mr.
      Stephen, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring that decanter back. Didn't you hear me tell you just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Stephen, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gumble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to bring that decanter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old butler bowed, and ambled from the room, and for a long while
      Siward sat sullenly listening and scoring the edges of the paper with his
      trembling pencil. Then the lead broke short, and he flung it from him and
      pulled the bell. Wands came this time, a lank, sandy, silent man, grown
      gray as a rat in the service of the Siwards. He received his master's
      orders, and withdrew; and again Siward waited, biting his under lip and
      tearing bits from the edges of the newspaper with fingers never still; but
      nobody came with the decanter, and after a while his tense muscles
      relaxed; something in his very soul seemed to snap, and he sank back in
      his chair, the hot tears blinding him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had got as far as that; moments of self-pity were becoming almost as
      frequent as scorching intervals of self-contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they all knew what was the matter with him&mdash;they all knew&mdash;the
      doctor, the servants, his friends. Had he not surprised the quick
      suspicion in Fleetwood's glance, when he told him he had slipped, and
      sprained his ankle? What if he had been drunk when he fell&mdash;fell on
      his own doorsteps, carried into the old Siward house by old Siward
      servants, drunk as his forefathers? It was none of Fleetwood's business.
      It was none of the servants' business. It was nobody's business except his
      own. Who the devil were all these people, to pry into his affairs and
      doctor him and dose him and form secret leagues to disobey him, and hide
      decanters from him? Why should anybody have the impertinence to meddle
      with him? Of what concern to them were his vices or his virtues?
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears dried in his hot eyes; he jerked the old-fashioned bell
      savagely; and after a long while he heard servants whispering together in
      the passageway outside his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay very still in his chair; his hearing had become abnormally acute,
      but he could not make out what they were saying; and as the dull,
      intestinal aching grew sharper, parching, searing every strained muscle in
      throat and chest, he struck the table beside him, and clenched his teeth
      in the fierce rush of agony that swept him from head to foot, crying out
      an inarticulate menace on his household. And Dr. Grisby came into the room
      from the outer shadows of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very small, very meagre, very bald, and clean-shaven, with a face
      like a nut-cracker; and the brown wig he wore was atrocious, and curled
      forward over his colourless ears. He wore steel-rimmed spectacles, each
      glass divided into two lenses; and he stood on tiptoe to look out through
      the upper lenses on the world, and always bent almost double to use the
      lower or reading lenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides that, he affected frilled shirts, and string ties, which nobody
      had ever seen snugly tied. His loose string tie was the first thing Siward
      could remember about the doctor; and that the doctor had permitted him to
      pull it when he had the measles, at the age of six.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's all this racket?&rdquo; said the little old doctor harshly. &ldquo;Got colic?
      Got the toothache? I'm ashamed of you, Stephen, cutting capers and
      pounding the furniture! Look up! Look at me! Out with your tongue! Well,
      now, what the devil's the trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;know,&rdquo; muttered Siward, abandoning his wrist to the little man,
      who seated himself beside him. Dr. Grisby scarcely noted the pulse; the
      delicate pressure had become a strong caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know what?&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;How do I know what's the matter with you? Hey?
      Now, now, don't try to explain, Steve; don't fly off the handle! All
      right; grant that I do know what's bothering you; I want to see that ankle
      first. Here, somebody! Light that gas. Why the mischief don't you have the
      house wired for electricity, Stephen? It's wholesome. Gas isn't. Lamps are
      worse, sir. Do as I tell you!&rdquo; And he went on loquaciously, grumbling and
      muttering, and never ceasing his talk, while Siward, wincing as the
      dressing was removed, lay back and closed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later Gumble appeared, to announce dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want any,&rdquo; said Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat!&rdquo; said Dr. Grisby harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;don't care to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat, I tell you! Do you think I don't mean what I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he ate his broth and toast, the doctor curtly declining to join him. He
      ate hurriedly, closing his eyes in aversion. Even the iced tea was flat
      and distasteful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at last he lay back, white and unstrung, the momentarily deadened
      desperation glimmering under his half-closed eyes. And for a long while
      Dr. Grisby sat, doubled almost in two, cuddling his bony little knees and
      studying the patterns in the faded carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you'd better go, Stephen,&rdquo; he said at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up the river&mdash;to Mulqueen's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Let's try it, Steve. You'll be on your feet in two weeks. Then you'd
      better go&mdash;up the river&mdash;to Mulqueen's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I'll go, if you say so. But I can't go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't say go now. I said in two weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give me your word?&rdquo; demanded the doctor sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I may have to be here on business. There seems to be some sort of
      crisis coming which I don't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a crisis right here, Steve, which I understand!&rdquo; snapped Dr.
      Grisby. &ldquo;Face it like a man! Face it like a man! You're sick&mdash;to your
      bones, boy&mdash;sick! sick! Fight the fight, Steve! Fight a good fight.
      There's a fighting chance; on my soul of honour, there is, Steve, a
      fighting chance for you! Now! now, boy! Buckle up tight! Tuck up your
      sword-sleeve! At 'em, Steve! Give 'em hell! Oh, my boy, my boy, I know; I
      know!&rdquo; The little man's voice broke, but he steadied it instantly with a
      snap of his nut-cracker jaws, and scowled on his patient and shook his
      little withered fist at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His patient lay very still in the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to go,&rdquo; said the doctor harshly, &ldquo;before your self-control
      goes. Do you understand? I want you to go before your decision is
      undermined; before you begin to do devious things, sly things, cheating
      things, slinking things&mdash;anything and everything to get at the thing
      you crave. I've given you something to fight with, and you won't take it
      faithfully. I've given you free rein in tobacco and tea and coffee. I've
      helped you as much as I dare to weather the nights. Now, you help me&mdash;do
      you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say so; now do it. Do something for yourself. Do anything! If you're
      sick of reading&mdash;and I don't blame you, considering the stuff you
      read&mdash;get people down here to see you; get lots of people. Telephone
      'em; you've a telephone there, haven't you? There it is, by your elbow.
      Use it! Call up people. Talk all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Now, Steve, we know what's the matter, physically, don't we? Of
      course we do! Now, then, what's the matter mentally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mentally?&rdquo; repeated Siward under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mentally. What's the trouble? Stocks? Bonds? Lawsuits? Love?&rdquo; the
      slightest pause, and a narrowing of the gimlet eyes behind the lenses.
      &ldquo;Love?&rdquo; he repeated harshly. &ldquo;Which is it, boy? They're all good to let
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business,&rdquo; said Siward. But, being a Siward, he was obliged to add
      &ldquo;partly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business&mdash;partly,&rdquo; repeated the doctor. &ldquo;What's the matter with
      business&mdash;partly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. There are rumours. Hetherington is pounding us&mdash;apparently.
      That Inter-County crowd is acting ominously, too. There's something
      underhand, somewhere.&rdquo; He bent his head and fell to plucking at the faded
      brocade on the arm of his chair, muttering to himself, &ldquo;somewhere,
      somehow, something underhand. I don't know what; I really don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right&mdash;all right,&rdquo; said the doctor testily; &ldquo;let it go at that!
      There's treachery, eh? You suspect it? You're sure of it&mdash;as
      reasonably sure as a gentleman can be of something he is not fashioned to
      understand? That's it, is it? All right, sir&mdash;all right! Very well&mdash;ver-y
      well. Now, sir, look at me! Business symptoms admitted, what about the
      'partly,' Stephen?&mdash;what about it, eh? What about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Siward fell silent again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Did you say something? No? Oh, very well, ver-y well, sir....
      Perfectly correct, Stephen. You have not earned the right to admit further
      symptoms. No, sir, you have not earned the right to admit them to anybody,
      not even to yourself. Nor to&mdash;her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have&mdash;admitted them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To yourself, Steve? I'm sorry. You have no right to&mdash;yet. I'm sorry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have admitted them&mdash;admitted them&mdash;to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; said the doctor grimly, &ldquo;that clinches it! That locks
      you to the wheel! That pledges you. The squabble is on, now. It's your
      honour that's engaged now, not your nerves, not your intestines. It's a
      good fight&mdash;a very good fight, with no chance of losing anything but
      life. You go up the river to Mulqueen's. That's the strategy in this
      campaign; that's excellent manoeuvring; that's good generalship! Eh? Mask
      your purpose, Steve; make a feint of camping out here under my guns; then
      suddenly fling your entire force up the Hudson and fortify yourself at
      Mulqueen's! Ho, that'll fix 'em! That's going to astonish the enemy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His harsh, dry, crackling laughter broke out like the distant rattle of
      musketry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ghost of a smile glimmered in Siward's haunted eyes, then faded as he
      leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has refused me,&rdquo; he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little doctor, after an incredulous stare, began chattering with
      wrath. &ldquo;Refused you! Pah! Pooh! That's nothing! That signifies absolutely
      nothing! It's meaningless! It's a detail. You get well&mdash;do you hear?
      You go and get well; then try it again! Then you'll see! And if she is an
      idiot&mdash;in the event of her irrational persistence in an incredible
      and utterly indefensible attitude&rdquo;&mdash;he choked up, then fairly barked
      at Siward&mdash;&ldquo;take her anyway, sir! Run off with her! Dominate
      circumstances, sir! take charge of events!... But you can't do it till
      you've clapped yourself into prison for life.... And God help you if you
      let yourself escape!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And after a long while Siward said: &ldquo;If I should ever marry&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had children, eh? Is that it? Oh, it is, eh? Well, I say, marry! I say,
      have children! If you're a man, you'll breed men. The chances are they may
      not inherit what you have. It skips some generations&mdash;some, now and
      then. But if they do, good God! I say it's better to be born and have a
      chance to fight than never to come into the arena at all! By winning out,
      the world learns; by failure, the world is no less wise. The important
      thing is birth. The main point is to breed&mdash;to produce&mdash;to
      reproduce! but not until you stand, sword in hand, and your armed heel on
      the breast of your prostrate and subconscious self!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jumped up and began running about the room with short little bantam
      steps, talking all the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People say, 'Shall criminals be allowed to mate and produce young? Shall
      malefactors be allowed to beget? No!' And I say no, too. Never so long as
      they remain criminals and malefactors; so long as the evil in them is in
      the ascendant. Never, until they are cured. That's what I say; that's what
      I maintain. Crime is a disease; criminals are sick people. No marriage for
      them until they're cured; no children for them until they're well. If they
      cure themselves, let 'em marry; let 'em breed; for then, if their children
      inherit the inclination, they also inherit the grit to cauterise the
      malady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He produced a huge handkerchief from the tails of his coat, and wiped his
      damp features and polished his forehead so violently that his wig took a
      new and jaunty angle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm talking too much,&rdquo; he said fretfully; &ldquo;I'm talking a great deal&mdash;all
      the time&mdash;continually. I've other patients&mdash;several&mdash;plenty!
      Do you think you're the only man I know who's trying to disfigure his
      liver and make spots come out all over inside him? Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward smiled again, a worn, pallid smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can stand it while you are here, doctor, but when I'm alone it's&mdash;hard.
      One of those crises is close now. I've a bad night ahead&mdash;a bad
      outlook. Couldn't you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just enough&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Stephen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;Enough to dull it&mdash;just a little? I don't ask for enough to
      make me sleep&mdash;not even to make me doze. You have your needle;
      haven't you, doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, just this once&mdash;for the last time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Are you afraid? You needn't be, doctor. I don't care for it except
      to give me a little respite, a little rest on a night like this. I'm so
      tired of this ache. If I could only have some sleep, and wake up in good
      shape, I'd stand a better chance of fighting.... Wait, doctor! Just one
      moment. I don't mean to be a coward, but I've had a hard fight, and&mdash;I'm
      tired.... If you could see your way to helping me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not help you any more that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a dead silence, broken at last by the doctor with a violent
      gesture toward the telephone. &ldquo;Talk to the girl! Why don't you talk to the
      girl! If she's worth a hill o' beans she'll help you to hang on. What's
      she for, if she isn't for such moments? Tell her you need her voice; tell
      her you need her faith in you. Damn central! Talk out in church! Don't
      make a goddess of a woman. The men who want to marry her, and can't, will
      do that! The nincompoop can always be counted on to deify the commonplace.
      And she is commonplace. If she isn't, she's no good! Commend me to sanity
      and the commonplace. I take off my hat to it! I honour it. God bless it!
      Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward lay still for a long while after the doctor had gone. More than an
      hour had passed before he slowly sat up and groped for the telephone book,
      opened it, and searched in a blind, hesitating way until he found the
      number he was looking for.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never telephoned to her; he had never written her except once, in
      reply to her letter in regard to his mother's death&mdash;that strange,
      timid, formal letter, in which, grief-stunned as he was, he saw only the
      formality, and had answered it more formally still. And that was all that
      had come of the days and nights by that northern sea&mdash;a letter and
      its answer, and silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, thinking of these things, he shut the book wearily, and lay back in
      the shadow of the faded curtain, closing his sunken eyes.

      CHAPTER IX CONFESSIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a city in transition, where yesterday is as dead as a dead century,
      where those who prepare the old year for burial are already taking the
      ante-mortem statement of the new, the future fulfils the functions of the
      present. Time itself is considered merely as a by-product of horse-power,
      discounted with flippancy as the unavoidable friction clogging the
      fly-wheel of progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Memory, once a fine art, is becoming a lost art in Manhattan.
    </p>
    <p>
      His world and his city had almost ceased to think of Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few weeks men spoke of him in the several clubs of which he had
      lately been a member&mdash;spoke of him always in the past tense; and
      after a little while spoke of him no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that section of the social system which he had inhabited, his absence
      on account of his mother's death being taken for granted, people laid him
      away in their minds almost as ceremoniously as they had laid away the
      memory of his mother. Nothing halted because he was not present; nothing
      was delayed, rearranged, or abandoned because his familiar presence
      chanced to be missing. There remained only one more place to fill at a
      cotillion, dinner, or bridge party; only another man for opera box or
      week's end; one man the more to be counted on, one more man to be counted
      out&mdash;transferred to the credit of profit and loss, and the ledger
      closed for the season.
    </p>
    <p>
      They who remembered him, among those who had not yet lost that
      old-fashioned art, were very few&mdash;a young girl here and there, over
      whom he had been absent-mindedly sentimental; a dÃ©butante or two who had
      adored him from a distance as a friend of elder sister or brother; here
      and there an old, old lady to whom he had been considerate, and who
      perhaps remembered something of the winning charm of the Siwards when the
      town was young&mdash;his father, perhaps, perhaps his grandfather&mdash;these
      thought of him at intervals; the remainder had no leisure to remember even
      if they had not forgotten how to do it. Several cabmen missed him for a
      while; now and then a privileged cafÃ© waiter inquired about him from gay,
      noisy parties entering some old haunt of his. Mr. Desmond, of art gallery
      and roulette notoriety, whose business is not to forget, was politely
      regretful at his absence from certain occult ceremonies which he had at
      irregular intervals graced with votive offerings. And the list ended there&mdash;almost,
      not quite; for there were two people who had not forgotten Siward: Howard
      Quarrier and Beverly Plank; and one other, a third, who could not yet
      forget him if she would&mdash;but, as yet, she had not tried very
      desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day that Siward left New York to visit everybody's friend, Mr.
      Mulqueen, in the country, Plank called on him for the second time in his
      life, and was presently received in the south drawing-room, the library
      being limited to an informality and intimacy not for Mr. Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Siward, still lame, and using unskilfully two shiny new crutches, came
      down the stairs and stumped into the drawing-room, which, in spite of the
      sombre, clustering curtains, was brightly illuminated by the winter
      sunshine reflected from the snow in the street. Plank was shocked at the
      change in him&mdash;at the ghost of a voice, listlessly formal; at the
      thin, nerveless hand offered; startled, so that he forgot his shyness, and
      retained the bony hand tightly in his, and instinctively laid his other
      great cushion-like paw over it, holding it imprisoned, unable to speak,
      unconscious, in the impulse of the moment, of the liberty he permitted
      himself, and which he had never dreamed of taking with such a man as
      Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect on Siward was composite; his tired voice ceased; surprise,
      inability to understand tinged with instinctive displeasure, were
      succeeded by humourous curiosity; and, very slowly it became plain to him
      that this beefy young man liked him, was naively concerned about him, felt
      friendly toward him, and was showing it as spontaneously as a child.
      Because he now understood something of how it is with a man who is in the
      process of being forgotten, his perceptions were perhaps the finer in
      these days, and the direct unconsciousness of Plank touched him more
      heavily than the pair of heavy hands enclosing his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I'd come,&rdquo; began Plank, growing redder and redder as he began
      to realise the enormity of familiarity committed only on the warrant of
      impulse. &ldquo;You don't look well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was good of you to think of me,&rdquo; said Siward. &ldquo;Come up to the library,
      if you've a few minutes to spare an invalid. Please go first; I'm a trifle
      lame yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I am sorry,&rdquo; muttered Plank, &ldquo;very, very sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At first, in the library, Plank was awkward and silent, finding nothing to
      say, and nowhere to dispose of his hands, until Siward gave him a cigar to
      occupy his fingers. Even then he continued to sit uncomfortably, his bulk
      balanced on a rickety, spindle-legged chair, which he stubbornly refused
      to exchange for another, at Siward's suggestion, out of sheer
      embarrassment, and with a confused idea that his refusal would somehow
      ultimately put him at his ease with his surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Siward, secretly amused, rang for tea, although the hour was early. After
      a little while, either the toast or the tea appeared to act on Plank as a
      lingual laxative, for he began suddenly to talk, which is characteristic
      of bashful men; and Siward gravely helped him on when he floundered and
      turned shy. After a little, matters went very well with them, and Plank,
      much more at ease than he had ever dared to hope he could be with Siward,
      talked and talked; and Siward, his crutches across his knees, lay back in
      his arm-chair, chatting with that winning informality so becoming to men
      who are unconscious of their charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching Plank, it occurred to him gradually that this great, cumbersome
      creature was not a shrewd, thrifty, self-made and self-finished adult at
      all; only a big, wistful, lonely boy, without comrades and with nowhere to
      play. On Plank's round face there remained no trace of shrewdness, of
      stubbornness, nothing even of the heavy, saturnine placidity of a dogged
      man who waits his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank spoke of himself after a while, sounding the personal note with
      tentative timidity. Siward gravely encouraged him, and in a little while
      the outlines of his crude autobiography appeared, embodying his eventless
      boyhood in a Pennsylvania town; his career at the high school; the dawning
      desire for college equipment, satisfied by his father, who owned shares in
      the promising Deepvale Steel Plank Company; the unhappy years at Harvard&mdash;hard
      years, for he learned with difficulty; solitary years, for he was not
      sought by those whom he desired to know. Then he ventured to speak of his
      father's growing interest in steel; the merging and absorbing of
      independent plants; his own entry upon the scene on the death of his
      father; and&mdash;the rest&mdash;material fortune and prosperity, which,
      perhaps, might stand substitute as a social sponsor for him; stand,
      perhaps, for something of what he lacked in himself, which only long
      residence amid the best, long-formed habits for the best, or a long
      inheritance of the best could give. Did Siward think so? Was the best
      beyond his reach? Was it hopeless for such a man as he to try? And why?
    </p>
    <p>
      The innocent snobbery, the abashed but absolute simplicity of this
      ponderous pilgrim from the smelting pits clambering upward through the
      high school of the smoky town, groping laboriously through the chilly
      halls of Harvard toward the outer breastworks of Manhattan, interested
      Siward; and he said so in his pleasant way, without offence, and with a
      smiling question at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worth while?&rdquo; repeated Plank, flushing heavily, &ldquo;it is worth while to me.
      I have always desired to be a part of the best that there is in my own
      country; and the best is here, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not necessarily,&rdquo; said Siward, still smiling. &ldquo;The noisiest is here, and
      some of the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is the best?&rdquo; inquired Plank naively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, all plain people, whose education, breeding, and fortune permit them
      the luxury of thinking, and whose tastes, intelligence, and sanity enable
      them to express their thoughts. There are such people here, and some of
      them form a portion of the gaudier and noisier galaxy we call society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I wish to be part of,&rdquo; said Plank. &ldquo;Could you tell me what
      are the requirements?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe I could, exactly,&rdquo; said Siward, amused. &ldquo;With us, the
      social system, as an established and finished system, has too recently
      been evolved from outer chaos to be characteristic of anything except the
      crudity and energy of the chaos from which it emerged. The balance between
      wealth, intelligence, and breeding has not yet been established&mdash;not
      from lack of wealth or intelligence. The formula has not been announced,
      that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the formula?&rdquo; insisted Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The formula is the receipt for a real society,&rdquo; replied Siward, laughing.
      &ldquo;At present we have its uncombined ingredients in the raw&mdash;noisy
      wealth and flippant fashion, arrogant intelligence and dowdy breeding&mdash;all
      excellent materials, when filtered and fused in the retort; and many of
      our test tubes have already precipitated pure metal besides, and our
      national laboratory is turning out fine alloys. Some day we'll understand
      the formula, and we'll weld the entire mass; and that will be society, Mr.
      Plank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the meanwhile,&rdquo; repeated Plank, unsmiling, &ldquo;I want to be part of the
      best we have. I want to be part of the brightness of things. I mean, that
      I cannot be contented with an imitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An imitation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the best&mdash;of what you say is not yet society. I ask no more than
      your footing among the people of this city. I wish to be able to go where
      such men as you go; be permitted, asked, desired to be part of what you
      always have been part of. Is it a great deal I ask? Tell me, Mr. Siward&mdash;for
      I don't know&mdash;is it too much to expect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think it is a very high ambition,&rdquo; said Siward, smiling. &ldquo;What
      you ask is not very much to ask of life, Mr. Plank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is there any reason why I may not hope to go where I wish to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it depends upon yourself,&rdquo; said Siward, &ldquo;upon your capacity for
      being, or for making people believe you to be exactly what they require.
      You ask me whether you may be able to go where you desire; and I answer
      you that there is no limit to any journey except the sprinting ability of
      the pilgrim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank laughed a little, and his squared jaws relaxed; then, after a few
      moments' thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is curious that what you cast away from you so easily, I am waiting
      for with all the patience I have in me. And yet it is always yours to pick
      up again whenever you wish; and I may never live to possess it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was so perfectly right that Siward said nothing; in fact, he could have
      no particular interest or sympathy for a man's quest of what he himself
      did not understand the lack of. Those born without a tag unmistakably
      ticketing them and their positions in the world were perforce ticketed.
      Siward took it for granted that a man belonged where he was to be met; and
      all he cared about was to find him civil, whether he happened to be a
      policeman or a master of fox-hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, now that he knew Plank, contented to accept him anywhere he met
      him; but Plank's upward evolutions upon the social ladder were of no
      interest to him, and his naÃ¯ve snobbery was becoming something of a bore.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Siward directed the conversation into other channels, and Plank,
      accepting another cup of tea, became very communicative about his stables
      and his dogs, and the preservation of game; and after a while, looking up
      confidently at Siward, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it beastly to drive pheasants the way I did at Black Fells?
      I have heard that you were disgusted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't my idea of a square deal,&rdquo; said Siward frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That settles it, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you should not let me interfere with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take your opinion, and thank you for it. It didn't seem to me to be
      the thing; only it's done over here, you know. The De Coursay's and the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know.... Glad you feel that way about it, Plank. It's pretty
      rotten sportsmanship. Don't you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. I&mdash;would you&mdash;I should like to ask you to try some square
      shooting at the Fells,&rdquo; stammered Plank, &ldquo;next season, if you would care
      to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're very good. I should like to, if I were going to shoot at all; but
      I fancy my shooting days are over, for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business,&rdquo; nodded Siward, absently grave again. &ldquo;I see no prospect of my
      idling for the next year or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in&mdash;in Amalgamated Electric, I think,&rdquo; ventured Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much in,&rdquo; replied the other frankly. &ldquo;You've read the papers and
      heard rumours, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some. I don't suppose anybody quite understands the attacks on
      Amalgamated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't&mdash;not yet. Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank sat silent, then his shrewd under lip began to protrude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm wondering,&rdquo; he began cautiously, &ldquo;how much the Algonquin crowd
      understands about the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward's troubled eyes were on him as he spoke, watching closely,
      narrowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard that rumour before,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; said Plank, &ldquo;and it seems incredible.&rdquo; He looked warily at
      Siward. &ldquo;Suppose it is true that the Algonquin Trust Company is godfather
      to Inter-County. That doesn't explain why a man should kick his own door
      down when there's a bell to ring and servants to let him in&mdash;and out
      again, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have wondered,&rdquo; said Siward, &ldquo;whether the door he might be inclined to
      kick down is really his own door any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too,&rdquo; said Plank simply. &ldquo;It may belong to a personal enemy&mdash;if
      he has any. He could afford to have an enemy, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, hadn't you better&mdash;I beg your pardon! You have not asked me to
      advise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I may ask your advice some day. Will you give it when I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; said Plank, so warmly disinterested, so plainly proud and
      eager to do a service that Siward, surprised and touched, found no word to
      utter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank rose. Siward attempted to stand up, but had trouble with his
      crutches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don't try,&rdquo; said Plank, coming over and offering his hand. &ldquo;May I
      stop in again soon? Oh, you are off to the country for a month or two? I
      see.... You don't look very well. I hope it will benefit you. Awfully glad
      to have seen you. I&mdash;I hope you won't forget me&mdash;entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the man people are forgetting,&rdquo; returned Siward, &ldquo;not you. It was
      very nice of you to come. You are one of very few who remember me at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have very few people to remember,&rdquo; said Plank; &ldquo;and if I had as many as
      I could desire I should remember you first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he became very much embarrassed. Siward offered his hand again. Plank
      shook it awkwardly, and went away on tiptoe down the stairs which creaked
      decorously under his weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that ended the first interview between Plank and Siward in the first
      days of the latter's decline.
    </p>
    <p>
      The months that passed during Siward's absence from the city began to
      prove rather eventful for Plank. He was finally elected a member of the
      Patroons Club, without serious opposition; he had dined twice with the
      Kemp Ferralls; he and Major Belwether were seen together at the Caithness
      dance, and in the Caithness box at the opera. Once a respectable newspaper
      reported him at Tuxedo for the week's end; his name, linked with the
      clergy, frequently occupied such space under the column headed
      &ldquo;Ecclesiastical News&rdquo; as was devoted to the progress of the new chapel,
      and many old ladies began to become familiar with his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the right moment the Mortimers featured him between two fashionable
      bishops at a dinner. Mrs. Vendenning, who adored bishops, immediately
      remembered him among those asked to her famous annual bal poudrÃ©; a
      celebrated yacht club admitted him to membership; a whole shoal of
      excellent minor clubs which really needed new members followed suit, and
      even the rock-ribbed Lenox, wearied of its own time-honoured immobility,
      displayed the preliminary fidgets which boded well for the stolid
      candidate. The Mountain was preparing to take the first stiff step toward
      Mohammed. It was the prophet's cue to sit tight and yawn occasionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile he didn't want to; he was becoming anxious to do things for
      himself, which Leila Mortimer, of course, would not permit. It was
      difficult for him to understand that any effort of his own would probably
      be disastrous; that progress could come only through his own receptive
      passivity; that nothing was demanded, nothing required, nothing permitted
      from him as yet, save a capacity for assimilating such opportunities as
      sections of the social system condescended to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, he wanted to open his art gallery to the public; he said it
      was good strategy; and Mrs. Mortimer sat upon the suggestion with a shrug
      of her pretty shoulders. Well, then, couldn't he possibly do something
      with his great, gilded ball-room? No, he couldn't; and the less in
      evidence his galleries and his ball-rooms were at present the better his
      chances with people who, perfectly aware that he possessed them, were very
      slowly learning to overlook the insolence of the accident that permitted
      him to possess what they had never known the want of. First of all people
      must tire of repeating to each other that he was nobody, and that would
      happen when they wearied of explaining to one another why he was ever
      asked anywhere. There was time enough for him to offer amusement to people
      after they had ceased to find amusement in snubbing him; plenty of time in
      the future for them to lash him to a gallop for their pleasure. In the
      meanwhile he was doing very well, because he began to appear regularly in
      the Caithness-Bonnesdel box, and old Peter Caithness was already boring
      him at the Patroons; which meant that the thrifty old gentleman considered
      Plank's millions as a possible underpinning for the sagging house of
      Caithness, of which his pallid daughter Agatha was the sole sustaining
      caryatid in perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he was doing well; for that despotic beauty, Sylvia Landis, whose
      capricious perversity had recently astonished those who remembered her in
      her first season as a sweet, reasonable, and unspoiled girl, was always
      friendly with him. That must be looked upon as important, considering
      Sylvia's unassailable position, and her kinship to the autocratic old lady
      whose kindly ukase had for generations remained the undisputed law in the
      social system of Manhattan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another matter,&rdquo; said Leila Mortimer innocently, as Plank,
      lingering after a disastrous rubber of bridge with her, her husband, and
      Agatha Caithness, had followed her into her own apartments to write his
      cheque for what he owed. &ldquo;You've driven with me so much and you come here
      so often and we are seen together so frequently that the clans are
      sharpening up their dirks for us. And that helps some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Plank, reddening, and twisting around in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. You didn't suppose I could escape, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Escape! What?&rdquo; demanded Plank, getting redder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Escape being talked about, savagely, mercilessly. Can't you see how it
      helps? Oh dear, are you stupid, Beverly?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; replied Plank, staring, &ldquo;just how stupid I am. If you mean
      that I'm compromising you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please! Why do you use back-stairs words? Nobody talks about
      compromising now; all that went out with New Year's calls and brown-stone
      stoops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they call it, then?&rdquo; asked Plank seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call what? you great boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say I'm doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who does?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila laughed, leaned back in her big, padded chair, dropping one knee
      over the other. Her dark eyes with the Japanese slant to them rested
      mockingly on Plank, who had now turned completely around in his chair,
      leaving his half-written cheque on her escritoire behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're simply credited with an affair with a pretty woman,&rdquo; she said,
      watching the dull colour mounting to his temples, &ldquo;and that is certain to
      be useful to you, and it doesn't affect me. What on earth are you blushing
      about?&rdquo; And as he said nothing, she added, with a daring little laugh:
      &ldquo;You are credited with being very agreeable, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If&mdash;if that's the way you take it&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! What do you expect me to do&mdash;call for help before I'm
      hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that this talk&mdash;gossip&mdash;doesn't hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How silly!&rdquo; She looked at him, smiling. &ldquo;You know how likely I am to
      require protection from your importunities.&rdquo; She dropped her pretty head,
      and began plaiting with her fingers the silken gown over her knee. &ldquo;Or how
      likely I would be to shriek for it even if&rdquo;&mdash;she looked up with
      childlike directness&mdash;&ldquo;even if I needed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you can take care of yourself,&rdquo; said Plank, wincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could, if I wanted to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody knows that. I know it, Leroy knows it; only I don't care to
      figure as that kind of man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Already he had lost sight of her position in the matter; and she drew a
      long, quiet breath, almost like a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time enough after you marry,&rdquo; she said deliberately, and lighted a
      cigarette from a candle, recreating her knees the other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered her, started to speak, checked himself, and swung around to
      the desk again. His pen hovered over the space to be filled in. He tried
      to recollect the amount, hesitated, dated the cheque and affixed his
      signature, still trying to remember; then he looked at her over his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forget the exact amount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She surveyed him through the haze of her cigarette, but made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forget the amount,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; she nodded indolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it go. Besides, I shall not accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flushed up, astonished. &ldquo;You can't refuse to take a gambling debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she retorted coolly. &ldquo;I'm tired of taking your money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you won it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm tired of winning it. It is all I ever do win... from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her pretty head was wreathed in smoke. She tipped the ashes from the
      cigarette's end, watching them fall to powder on the rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what you mean,&rdquo; he persisted doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you? I don't believe I do, either. There are intervals in my career
      which might prove eloquent if I opened my lips. But I don't, except to
      make floating rings and cabalistic signs out of cigarette smoke. Can you
      read their meaning? Look! There goes one, and there's another, and another&mdash;all
      twisting and uncurling into hieroglyphics. They are very significant; they
      might tell you a lot of things, if you would only translate them. But you
      haven't the key&mdash;have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a heavy, jarring step in the main living-room, and Mortimer's
      bulk darkened the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Entrez, mon ami,&rdquo; nodded Leila, glancing up. &ldquo;Where is Agatha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to Desmond's,&rdquo; he grunted, ignoring his wife's question; &ldquo;do
      you want to try it again, Beverly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't make Leila take her own winnings,&rdquo; said Plank, holding out the
      signed but unfilled cheque to Mortimer, who took it and scrutinised it for
      a moment, rubbing his heavy, inflamed eyes; then, gesticulating, the
      cheque fluttering in his puffy fingers:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;I've a notion that I can give Desmond a whirl
      that he won't forget in a hurry. Agatha's asleep; she's going to that ball&mdash;where
      is it?&rdquo; he demanded, turning on his wife. &ldquo;Yes, yes; the Page blow-out.
      You're going, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila nodded, and lighted another cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; continued Mortimer impatiently; &ldquo;you and Agatha won't start
      before one. And if you think Plank had better go, why, we'll be back here
      in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means you won't be back at all,&rdquo; observed his wife coolly; &ldquo;and it's
      good policy for Beverly to go where he's asked. Can't you turn in and
      sleep, now, and amuse your friend Desmond to-morrow night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can't. What a fool I'd be to let a chance slip when I feel like a
      winner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never feel otherwise when you gamble,&rdquo; said Leila.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; he retorted peevishly. &ldquo;I can tell almost every time what the
      cards are going to do to me. Leila, go to sleep. We'll be back here for
      you by one, or half past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Leroy,&rdquo; began Plank, &ldquo;there's one thing I can't stand for, and
      that's this continual loss of sleep. If I go with you I'll not be fit to
      go to the Pages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a farmer you are!&rdquo; sneered Mortimer. &ldquo;I believe you roost on the
      foot-board of your bed, like a confounded turkey. Come on! You'd better
      begin training, you know. People in this town are not going to stand for
      the merry ploughboy game, you see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Plank was shrewdly covering his principal reason for declining; he had
      too often &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo; assisted Mortimer at Desmond's and Burbank's, when
      Mortimer, cleaned out and unable to draw against a balance non-existent,
      had plucked him by the sleeve from the faro table with the breathless
      request for a loan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I can wring Desmond dry to-night,&rdquo; repeated Mortimer sullenly.
      &ldquo;It isn't a case of 'want to,' either; it's a case of 'got to.' That old
      pink-and-white rabbit, Belwether, got me into a game this afternoon, and
      between him and Voucher and Alderdine I'm stripped clean as a kennel
      bone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Plank shook his head, pretending to yawn; and Mortimer, glowering and
      lingering, presently went off, his swollen hands thrust into his trousers'
      pockets, his gross features dark with disgust; and presently they heard
      the front door slam, and a rattling tattoo of horses' feet on the asphalt;
      and Leila sprang up impatiently, and, passing Plank, traversed the passage
      to the windows of the front room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's taken the horses&mdash;the beast!&rdquo; she said calmly, as Plank joined
      her at the great windows and looked out into the night, where the round,
      drooping, flower-like globes of the electric lamps spread a lake of silver
      before the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rather rough on Leila. The Mortimers maintained one pair of horses
      only; and the use given them at all hours resulted in endless scenes, and
      an utter impossibility for Leila to retain the same coachman and footman
      for more than a few weeks at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't come back; he'll keep Martin and the horses standing in front of
      Delmonico's all night. You'd better call up the stables, Beverly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Plank called up a livery and arranged for transportation at one; and
      Leila seated herself at a card-table and began to deal herself cold decks,
      thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That bit in 'Carmen,'&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it always brings the shudder; it never
      palls on me, never grows stale.&rdquo; She whipped the ominous spade from the
      pack and held it out. &ldquo;La Mort!&rdquo; she exclaimed in mock tragedy, yet there
      was another undertone ringing through it, sounding, too, in her following
      laugh. &ldquo;Draw!&rdquo; she commanded, holding out the pack; and Plank drew a
      diamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; she nodded, shuffling the pack with her smooth, savant
      fingers and laying them out as she repeated the formula: &ldquo;Qui frappe? Qui
      entre? Qui prend chaise? Qui parle? Oh, the deuce! it's always the same!
      Tiens! je m'ennui!&rdquo; There was a flash of her bare arm, a flutter, and the
      cards fell in a shower over them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank flipped a card from his knee, laughing uncertainly, aware of
      symptoms in his pretty vis-Ã -vis which always made him uncomfortable. For
      months, now, at certain intervals, these recurrent symptoms had made him
      wary; but what they might portend he did not know, only that, alone with
      her, moments occurred when he was heavily aware of a tension which, after
      a while, affected even his few thick nerves. One of those intervals was
      threatening now: her flushed cheeks, her feverish activity with her hands,
      the unconscious reflex movement of her silken knees and restless slippers,
      all foreboded it. Next would come the nervous laughter, the swift epigram
      which bored and puzzled him, the veiled badinage he was unequal to; and
      then the hint of weariness, the curious pathos of long silences, the
      burnt-out beauty of her eyes from which the fire had gone as though
      quenched by invisible tears within.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ascribed it&mdash;desired to ascribe it&mdash;to her relations with her
      husband. He had naturally learned and divined how matters stood with them;
      he had learned considerable in the last month or two&mdash;something of
      Mortimer's record as a burly brother to the rich; something of his
      position among those who made no question of his presence anywhere.
      Something of Leila, too, he had heard, or rather deduced from hinted word
      or shrug or smiling silence, not meant for him, but indifferent to what he
      might hear and what he might think of what he heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did listen; he did patiently add two and two in the long solitudes of
      his Louis XV chamber; and if the results were not always four, at least
      they came within a fraction of the proper answer. And this did not alter
      his policy or weaken his faith in his mentors; nor did it impair his real
      gratitude to them, and his real and simple friendship for them both. He
      was faithful in friendship once formed, obstinately so, for better or for
      worse; but he was shrewd enough to ignore opportunities for friendships
      which he foresaw could do him no good on his plodding pilgrimage toward
      the temple of his inexorable desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lifting, now, his Delft-coloured eyes furtively, he studied the
      silk-and-lace swathed figure of the young matron opposite, flung back into
      the depths of her great chair, profile turned from him, her chin
      imprisoned in her ringed fingers. The brooding abandon of the attitude
      contrasted sharply with the grooming of the woman, making both the more
      effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn in, if you want to,&rdquo; she said, her voice indistinct, smothered by
      her pink palm. &ldquo;You're to dress in Leroy's quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to turn in just yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you needed sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. But it's not eleven yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slipped into another posture, reaching for a cigarette, and, setting
      it afire from the match he offered, exhaled a cloud of smoke and looked
      dreamily through it at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; she asked in a colourless voice. &ldquo;Tell me, for I don't know.
      Agatha? Marion Page? Mrs. Vendenning? or the Tassel girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody&mdash;yet,&rdquo; he admitted cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody&mdash;yet,&rdquo; she repeated, musing over her cigarette. &ldquo;That's good
      politics, if it's true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I untruthful?&rdquo; he asked simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Are you? You're a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk that way, Leila.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won't. What is it that you and Sylvia Landis have to talk about so
      continuously every time you meet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's merely civil to me,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's more than she is to a lot of people. What do you talk about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;nothing in particular; mostly about Shotover, and the
      people there last summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't she ever mention Stephen Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Usually. She knows I like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She likes him, too,&rdquo; said Leila, looking at him steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it. Everybody likes him&mdash;or did. I do, yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, too,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Mortimer coolly. &ldquo;I was in love with him. He
      was only a boy then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank nodded in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he now&mdash;do, you know?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Everybody says he's gone
      to the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's in the country somewhere,&rdquo; replied Plank cautiously. &ldquo;I stopped in
      to see him the other day, but nobody seemed to know when he would return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mortimer tossed her cigarette onto the hearth. For a long interval of
      silence she lay there in her chair, changing her position restlessly from
      moment to moment; and at length she lay quite still, so long that Plank
      began to think she had fallen asleep in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose. She did not stir, and, passing her, he instinctively glanced
      down. Her cheeks, half buried against the back of the chair, were
      overflushed; under the closed lids the lashes glistened wet in the
      lamplight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprised, embarrassed, he halted, as though afraid to move; and she sat
      up with a nervous shake of her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a life!&rdquo; she said, under her breath; &ldquo;what a life for a woman to
      lead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wh-whose?&rdquo; he blurted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her uneasily, finding nothing to say. He had never before
      heard anything like this from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't anybody help me out of it?&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? How?... Do you mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I mean it! I mean it! I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly she broke down, in a strange, stammering, tearless way,
      opening the dry flood-gates over which rattled an avalanche of words&mdash;bitter,
      breathless phrases rushing brokenly from lips that shrank as they formed
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank sat inert, the corroding echo of the words clattering in his ears.
      And after a while he heard his own altered voice sounding persistently in
      repetition:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't say those things, Leila; don't tell me such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Don't you care?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I care; but I can't do anything! I have no business to hear&mdash;to
      see you this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom can I speak, then, if I can not speak to you? To whom can I turn?
      Where am I to turn, in all the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; he said fearfully; &ldquo;the only way is to go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else have I done? What else am I doing?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Go on? Am I not
      trudging on and on through life, dragging the horror of it behind me
      through the mud, except when the horror drags me? To whom am I to turn&mdash;to
      other beasts like him?&mdash;sitting patiently around, grinning and
      slavering, awaiting their turn when the horror of it crushes me to the
      mud?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stretched out a rounded, quivering arm, and laid the small fingers of
      the left hand on its flawless contour. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she said, exasperated, &ldquo;I
      am young yet; the horror has not yet corrupted the youth in me. I am
      fashioned for some reason, am I not?&mdash;for some purpose, some
      happiness. I am not bad; I am human. What poison has soaked into me can be
      eliminated. I tell you, no woman is capable of being so thoroughly
      poisoned that the antidote proves useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you men, also, that unless she find that antidote she will
      surely reinfect herself. A man can not do what that man has done to me and
      expect me to recover unaided. People talk of me, and I have given them
      subjects enough! But&mdash;look at me! Straight between the eyes! Every
      law have I broken except that! Do you understand? That one, which you men
      consider yourselves exempt from, I have not broken&mdash;yet! Shall I
      speak plainer? It is the fashion to be crude. But&mdash;I can't be; I am
      unfashionable, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, her haunted eyes fixed on his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no chance for me? Because I drag his bedraggled name about with
      me is there no decent chance, no decent hope? Is there only indecency in
      prospect, if a man comes to care for a married woman? Can't a decent man
      love her at all? I&mdash;I think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hands, outstretched, trembled, then flew to her face; and she stood
      there swaying, until Plank perforce stepped to her side and steadied her
      against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they remained for a while, until she looked up dazed, weary, ashamed,
      expecting nothing of him; and when it came, leaving her still incredulous,
      his arms around her, his tense, flushed face recoiling from their first
      kiss, she did not seem to comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't turn on him,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;I&mdash;we are friends, you see. How
      can I love you, if that is so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you love me?&rdquo; she asked calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don't know. I did love&mdash;I do care for&mdash;another woman.
      I can't marry her, though I am given to understand there is a chance.
      Perhaps it is partly ambition,&rdquo; he said honestly, &ldquo;for I am quite sure she
      has never cared for me, never thought of me in that way. I think a man
      can't stand that long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; only women can. Who is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't ask me, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Are you sorry that I am in love with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His arms unclasped her body, and he stepped back, facing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; she asked violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak like a man,&rdquo; she said tremulously. &ldquo;Am I to be permitted to
      adore you in peace, then&mdash;decently, and in peace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't speak that way, Leila. I&mdash;there is no woman, no friend, I care
      for as much as I do you. It is easy, I think, for a woman, like you, to
      make a man care for her. You will not do it, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use; I can't turn on him. I can't! He is my friend, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him remain so. I shall do what I can. Let him remain a monument to
      his fellow-beasts. What do I care? Do you think I desire to turn you into
      his image? Do you think I hope for your degradation and mine? Are you
      afraid I should not recognise love unaccompanied by the attendant beast? I&mdash;I
      don't know; you had better teach me, if I prove blind. If you can love me,
      do so in charity before I go blind forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid one hand on his arm, looked at him, then turned and passed slowly
      through the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are going to sleep before we start you had better be about it!&rdquo;
       she said, looking back at him from the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had no further need of sleep; and for a long while he stood at the
      windows watching the lamps of cabs and carriages sparkling through the
      leafless thickets of the park like winter fire-flies.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one o'clock, hearing Agatha Caithness speak to Leila's maid, he left
      the window, and sitting down at the desk, telephoned to Desmond's; and he
      was informed that Mortimer, hard hit, had signified his intention of
      recouping at Burbank's. Then he managed to get Burbank's on the wire, and
      finally Mortimer himself, but was only cursed for his pains and cut off in
      the middle of his pleading.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he wandered up-stairs into Mortimer's apartments, where he tubbed and
      dressed, and finally descended, to find Agatha Caithness alone in the
      library, spinning a roulette wheel and whistling an air from &ldquo;La
      Bacchante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's pretty,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;sing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it's better off without the words; and so are you,&rdquo; added Agatha
      candidly, relinquishing the wheel and strolling with languid grace about
      the room, hands on her hips, timing her vagrant steps to the indolent,
      wicked air. And,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Je rougirais de men ivresse Si tu conservais ta raison!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      she hummed deliberately, pivoting on her heels and advancing again toward
      Plank, her pretty, pale face delicate as an enamelled cameo under the
      flood of light from the crystal chandeliers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand that Mr. Mortimer is not coming with us,&rdquo; she said
      carelessly. &ldquo;Are you going to dance with me, if I find nobody better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He expressed himself flattered, cautiously. He was one of many who never
      understood this tall, white, low-voiced girl, with eyes too pale for
      beauty, yet strangely alluring, too. Few men denied the indefinable
      enchantment of her; few men could meet her deep-lidded, transparent gaze
      unmoved. In the sensitive curve of her mouth there was a kind of
      sensuousness; in her low voice, in her pallor, in the slim grace of her a
      vague provocation that made men restless and women silently curious for
      something more definite on which to base their curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was wearing, over the smooth, dead-white skin of her neck, a collar of
      superb diamonds and aquamarines&mdash;almost an effrontery, as the latter
      were even darker than her eyes; yet the strange and effective harmony was
      evident, and Plank spoke of the splendour of the gems.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded indifferently, saying they were new, and that she had picked
      them up at Tiffany's; and he mentally sketched out the value of the
      diamonds, a trifle surprised, because Leila Mortimer had carefully
      informed him about the condition of the Caithness exchequer.
    </p>
    <p>
      That youthful matron herself appeared in a few moments, very lustrous,
      very lovely in her fragrant, exotic brightness, and Plank for the first
      time thought that she was handsome&mdash;the vigorous, youthful
      incarnation of Life itself, in contrast to Agatha's almost deathly beauty.
      She greeted him not only without a trace of embarrassment, but with such a
      friendly, fresh, gay confidence that he scarcely recognised in her the
      dry-eyed, feverish woman of an hour ago, whose very lips shrank back,
      scorched by the torrent of her own invective.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they drove the three short blocks to the Page's in their hired
      livery; the street was inadequate for the crush of vehicles; and the
      glittering pressure within the house was outrageous; all of which confused
      Plank, who became easily confused by such things.
    </p>
    <p>
      How they got in&mdash;how they managed to present themselves&mdash;who
      took Leila and Agatha from him&mdash;where they went&mdash;where he
      himself might be&mdash;he did not understand very clearly. The house was
      large, strange, full of strangers. He attempted to obtain his bearings by
      wandering about looking for a small rococo reception-room where he
      remembered he had once talked kennel talk with Marion Page, and had on
      another occasion perspired freely under the arrogant and strabismic glare
      of her mother. That good lady had really rather liked him; he never
      suspected it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he couldn't find the rococo room&mdash;or perhaps he didn't recognise
      it. So many people&mdash;so many, many people whom he did not know, whom
      he had never before laid eyes on&mdash;high-bred faces hard as diamonds;
      young, gay, laughing faces; brilliant eyes encountering his without a
      softening of recognition; clean-cut, attractive men in swarms, all
      animated, all amused, all at home among themselves and among the silken
      visions of loveliness passing and repassing, with here an extended gloved
      arm and the cordial greeting of camaraderie, there a quick smile, a swift
      turn in passing, a capricious bending forward for a whisper, a compliment,
      a jest&mdash;all this swept by him, around him, enveloping him with its
      brightness, its gaiety, its fragrance, and left him more absolutely alone
      than he had ever been in all his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to find Leila, and gave it up. He saw Quarrier talking to Agatha,
      but the former saluted him so coldly that he turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while he found Marion, but she hadn't a dance left for him;
      neither had Rena Bonnesdel, whom he encountered while she was adroitly
      avoiding one of the ever-faithful twins. The twin caught up with her in
      consequence, and she snubbed Plank for his share in the disaster, which
      depressed him, and he started for the smoking-room, wherever that haven
      might be found. He got into the ball-room, however, by mistake, and
      adorned the wall, during the cotillon, as closely as his girth permitted,
      until an old lady sent for him; and he went and talked about bishops for
      nearly an hour to her, until his condition bordered on frenzy, the old
      lady being deaf and peevish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, Alderdene used him to get rid of an angular, old harridan who
      seemed to be one solid diamond-mine, and who drove him into a corner and
      talked indelicacies until Plank's broad face flamed like the setting sun.
      Then Captain Voucher unloaded a frightened dÃ©butante on him who tried to
      talk about horses and couldn't; and they hated each other for a while,
      until, looking around her in desperation, she found he had vanished&mdash;which
      was quick work for a man of his size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kathryn Tassel employed him for supper, and kept him busy while she
      herself was immersed in a dawning affair with Fleetwood. She did
      everything to him except to tip him; and her insolence was the last straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, unexpectedly in the throng, two wonderful sea-blue eyes encountered
      his, deepening to violet with pleasure, and the trailing sweetness of a
      voice he knew was repeating his name, and a slim, white-gloved hand lay in
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her escort, Ferrall, nodded to him pleasantly. She leaned forward from
      Ferrall's arm, saying, under her breath, &ldquo;I have saved a dance for you.
      Please ask me at once. Quick! do you want me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I do,&rdquo; stammered Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferrall, suspicious, stepped forward to exchange civilities, then turning
      to the girl beside him: &ldquo;See here, Sylvia, you've dragged me all over this
      house on one pretext or another. Do you want any supper, or don't you? If
      you don't, it's our dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't. No, it isn't. Kemp, you annoy me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a nice thing to say! Is it your delicately inimitable way of
      giving me my congÃ©?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank you,&rdquo; nodded Miss Landis coolly; &ldquo;you may go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're spoiled, that's what's the matter,&rdquo; retorted Ferrall wrathfully.
      &ldquo;I thought I was to have this dance. You said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said 'perhaps,' because I didn't see Mr. Plank coming to claim it.
      Thank you, Kemp, for finding him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her nod and smile took the edge from her malice. Ferrall, who really
      adored dancing, glared about for anybody, and presently cornered the
      frightened and neglected debutante who had hated Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia, standing beside Plank, looked up at him with her confident and
      friendly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't care to dance, do you? Would you mind if we sat out this
      dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you'd rather,&rdquo; he said, so wistfully that she hesitated; then with a
      little shrug laid one hand on his arm, and they swung out across the floor
      together, into the scented whirl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank, like many heavy men, danced beautifully; and Sylvia, who still
      loved dancing with all the ardour of a schoolgirl, permitted a moment or
      two of keen delight to sweep her dreamily from her purpose. But that
      purpose must have been a strong one, for she returned to it in a few
      minutes, and, looking up at Plank, said very gently that she cared to
      dance no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hand resting lightly on his arm, it did not seem possible that any
      pressure of hers was directing them to the conservatory; yet he did not
      know where he was going, and she was familiar with the house, and they
      soon entered the conservatory, where, in the shadow of various palms
      various youths looked up impatiently as they passed, and various maidens
      sat up very straight in their chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Threading their dim way into the farther recesses they found seats among
      thickets of forced lilacs over-hung by early wistaria. A spring-like odour
      hung in the air; somewhere a tiny fountain grew musical in the
      semi-darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marion told me you had been asked,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We have been so friendly;
      you've always asked me to dance whenever we have met; so I thought I'd
      save you one. Are you flattered, Mr. Plank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said he was, very pleasantly, perfectly undeceived, and convinced of
      her purpose&mdash;a purpose never even tacitly admitted between them; and
      the old loneliness came over him again&mdash;not resentment, for he was
      willing that she should use him. Why not? Others used him; everybody used
      him; and if they found no use for him they let him alone. Mortimer,
      Fleetwood, Belwether&mdash;all, all had something to exact from him. It
      was for that he was tolerated&mdash;he knew it; he had slowly and
      unwillingly learned it. His intrusion among these people, of whom he was
      not one, would be endured only while he might be turned to some account.
      The hospital used him, the clergy found plenty for him to do for them, the
      museum had room for other pictures of his. Who among them all had ever
      sought him without a motive? Who among them all had ever found unselfish
      pleasure in him? Not one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in the dull sadness of his face, as he sat there, checked the
      first elaborately careless question her lips were already framing. Leaning
      a little nearer in the dim light she looked at him inquiringly and he
      returned her gaze in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Mr. Plank,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;is anything wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew that she did not mean to ask if anything was amiss with him. She
      did not care. Nobody cared. So, recognising his cue, he answered: &ldquo;No,
      nothing is wrong that I have heard of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wear a very solemn countenance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gaiety affects me solemnly, sometimes. It is a reaction from frivolity. I
      suppose that I am over-enjoying life; that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, using her fan, although the place was cool enough and they
      had not danced long. To and fro flitted the silken vanes of her fan, now
      closing impatiently, now opening again like the wings of a nervous moth in
      the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wished she would come to her point, but he dared not lead her to it too
      brusquely, because her purpose and her point were supposed to be
      absolutely hidden from his thick and credulous understanding. It had taken
      him some time to make this clear to himself; passing from suspicion,
      through chagrin and overwounded feeling, to dull certainty that she, too,
      was using him, harmlessly enough from her standpoint, but how bitterly
      from his, he alone could know.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quickened flutter of her fan meant impatience to learn from him what
      she had come to him to learn, and then, satisfied, to leave him alone
      again amid the peopled solitude of clustered lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wished she would speak; he was tired of the sadness of it all. Whenever
      in his isolation, in his utter destitution of friendship, he turned
      guilelessly to meet a new advance, always, sooner or later, the friendly
      mask was lifted enough for him to divine the cool, fixed gaze of
      self-interest inspecting him through the damask slits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia was speaking now, and the plumy fan was under savant control,
      waving graceful accompaniment to her soft voice, punctuating her sentences
      at times, at times making an emphasis or outlining a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the familiar sequence; topics that led to themes which adroitly
      skirted the salient point; returned capriciously, just avoiding it&mdash;a
      subtly charming pattern of words which required so little in reply that
      his smile and nod were almost enough to keep her aria and his
      accompaniment afloat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It began to fascinate him to watch the delicacy of her strategy, the
      coquetting with her purpose; her naive advance to the very edges of it,
      the airy retreat, the innocent detour, the elaborate and circuitous
      return. And at last she drifted into it so naturally that it seemed
      impossible that fatuous man could have the most primitive suspicion of her
      premeditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Plank, now recognising his cue, answered her: &ldquo;No, I have not heard
      that he is in town. I stopped to see him the other day, but nobody there
      knew how soon he intended to return from the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know he had gone to the country,&rdquo; she said without apparent
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Plank was either too kind to terminate the subject, or too anxious to
      serve his turn and release her; for he went on: &ldquo;I thought I told you at
      Mrs. Ferrall's that Mr. Siward had gone to the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you did. No doubt I've forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm quite sure I did, because I remember saying that he looked very ill,
      and you said, rather sharply, that he had no business to be ill. Do you
      remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;Is he better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hope so?&rdquo;&mdash;with the controlled emphasis of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Don't you, Miss Landis? When I saw him at his home, he was lame&mdash;on
      crutches&mdash;and he looked rather ghastly; and all he said was that he
      expected to leave for the country. I asked him to shoot next year at Black
      Fells, and he seemed bothered about business, and said it might keep him
      from taking any vacation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He spoke about his business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the trouble with his business? Is it anything about Amalgamated
      and Inter-County?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he worried?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank said deliberately: &ldquo;I should be, if my interests were locked up in
      Amalgamated Electric.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you tell me why that would worry you?&rdquo; she asked, smiling
      persuasively across at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can't tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I wouldn't understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I myself don't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thought awhile, brushing the rose velvet of her mouth with the fan's
      edge, then, looking up confidently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Siward is such a boy. I'm so glad he has you to advise him in such
      matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What matters?&rdquo; asked Plank bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, in&mdash;in financial matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't advise him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he hasn't asked me to, Miss Landis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to ask you.... He must ask you.... Don't wait for him, Mr.
      Plank. He is only a boy in such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, as Plank was silent:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what&mdash;make his business my business, without an invitation?&rdquo;
       asked Plank, so quietly that she flushed with annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you pretend to be his friend is it not your duty to advise him?&rdquo; she
      asked impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; that is for his business associates to do. Friendship comes to grief
      when it crosses the frontiers of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a narrow view to take, Mr. Plank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, straight and narrow. The boundaries of friendship are straight and
      narrow. It is best to keep to the trodden path; best not to walk on the
      grass or trample the flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are sacrificing friendship for an epigram,&rdquo; she said,
      careless of the undertone of contempt in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never sacrificed friendship.&rdquo; He turned, and looked at her
      pleasantly. &ldquo;I never made an epigram consciously, and I have never
      required of a friend more than I had to offer in return. Have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The flush of hot displeasure stained her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really questioning me, Mr. Plank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You have been questioning me rather seriously&mdash;have you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not comprehend your definition of friendship. I did not agree with
      it. I questioned it, not you! That is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank rested his head on one big hand and stared at the clusters of dim
      blossoms behind her; and after a while he said, as though thinking aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many have taken my friendship for granted, and have never offered their
      own in return. I do not know about Mr. Siward. There is nothing I can do
      for him, nothing he can do for me. If there is to be friendship between us
      it will be disinterested; and I would rather have that than anything in
      the world, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause; but when Sylvia would have broken it his gesture
      committed her to silence with the dignity one might use in checking a
      persistent child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You question my definition of friendship, Miss Landis. I should have let
      your question pass, however keenly it touched me, had it not also touched
      him. Now I am going to say some things which lie within the straight and
      narrow bounds I spoke of. I never knew a man I cared for as much as I care
      for Mr. Siward. I know why, too. He is disinterested. I do not believe he
      wastes very many thoughts on me. Perhaps he will. I want him to like me,
      if it's possible. But one thing you and I may be sure of: if he does not
      care to return the friendship I offer him he will never accept anything
      else from me, though he might give at my request; and that is the sort of
      a man he is; and that is why he is every inch a man; and so I like him,
      Miss Landis. Do you wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wonder?&rdquo; he repeated sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo; He straightened up, and the silent significance of his
      waiting attitude was plain enough to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she shook her head impatiently, saying: &ldquo;I don't know whose dance it
      is, and I don't care. Please go on. It is&mdash;is pleasant. I like Mr.
      Siward; I like to hear men speak of him as you do. I like you for doing
      it. If you should ever come to care for my friendship that is the best
      passport to it&mdash;your loyalty to Mr. Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No man can truthfully speak otherwise than I have spoken,&rdquo; he said
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not of these things. But&mdash;you know w-what is&mdash;is usually
      said when his name comes up among men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean about his habits?&rdquo; he asked simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Is it not an outrage to drag in that sort of thing? It angers me
      intensely, Mr. Plank. Why do they do it? Is there a single one among them
      qualified to criticise Mr. Siward? And besides, it is not true any
      more!... is it?&mdash;what was once said of him with&mdash;with some
      truth? Is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dull red blood mantled Plank's heavy visage. The silence grew grim as
      he did his slow, laborious thinking, the while his eyes, expressionless
      and almost opaque in the dim light, never left her's, until, under the
      unchanging, merciless inspection, the mask dropped for an instant from her
      anxious face, and he saw what he saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was no fool. What he had come to believe she at last had only
      confirmed; and now the question became simple: was she worth enlightening?
      And by what title did she demand his confidence?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask me if it is true any more. You mean about his habits. If I answer
      you it is because I cannot be indifferent to what concerns him. But before
      I answer I ask you this: Would your interest in his fortunes matter to
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited, head bent; then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, Mr. Plank,&rdquo; very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did your interest in his fortunes ever concern him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her sternly, his jaw squaring until his heavy under lip
      projected. &ldquo;Within my definition of friendship, is he your friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I mean you! I can answer for him. How is it with you? Do you return
      what he gives&mdash;if there is really friendship between you? Or do you
      take what he offers, offering nothing in return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had turned rather white under the direct impact of the questions. The
      jarring repetition of his voice itself was like the dull echo of distant
      blows. Yet it never occurred to her to resent it, nor his attitude, nor
      his self-assumed privilege. She did not care; she no longer cared what he
      said to her or thought about her; nor did she care that her mask had
      fallen at last. It was not what he was saying, but what her own heart
      repeated so heavily that drove the colour from her face. Not he, but she
      herself had become the pitiless attorney for the prosecution; not his
      voice, but the clamouring conscience within her demanded by what right she
      used the name of friendship to characterise the late relations between her
      and the man to whom she had denied herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a bitter impatience swept her, and a dawning fear, too; for she had
      set her foot on the fallen mask, and the impulse rendered her reckless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you speak?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yes, I have a right to know. I care for
      him as much as you do. Why don't you answer me? I tell you I care for
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; he said in a dull voice. &ldquo;Then help me out, if you can, for I
      don't know what to do; and if I did, I haven't the authority of friendship
      as my warrant. He is in New York. He did go to the country; and, at his
      home, the servants suppose he is still away. But he isn't; he is here,
      alone, and sick&mdash;sick of his old sickness. I saw him, and&rdquo;&mdash;Plank
      rested his head on his hand, dropping his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;and he didn't know
      me. I&mdash;I do not think he will remember that he met me, or that I
      spoke. And&mdash;I could do nothing, absolutely nothing. And I don't know
      where he is. He will go home after a while. I call&mdash;every day&mdash;to
      see&mdash;see what can be done. But if he were there I would not know what
      to do. When he does go home I won't know what to say&mdash;what to try to
      do.... And that is an answer to your question, Miss Landis. I give it,
      because you say you care for him as I do. Will you advise me what to do?&mdash;you,
      who are more entitled than I am to know the truth, because he has given
      you the friendship which he has as yet not accorded to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Sylvia, dry-eyed, dry-lipped, could find no voice to answer; and after
      a little while they rose and moved through the fragrant gloom toward the
      sparkling lights beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice came back as they entered the brilliant rooms: &ldquo;I should like to
      find Grace Ferrall,&rdquo; she said very distinctly. &ldquo;Please keep the others
      off, Mr. Plank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her small hand on his arm lay with a weight out of all proportion to its
      size. Fair head averted, she no longer guided him with that impalpable
      control; it was he who had become the pilot now, and he steered his own
      way through the billowy ocean of silk and lace, master of the course he
      had set, heavily bland to the interrupter and the importunate from whom
      she turned a deaf ear and dumb lips, and lowered eyes that saw nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fleetwood had missed his dance with her, but she scarcely heard his eager
      complaints. Quarrier, coldly inquiring, confronted them; was passed almost
      without recognition, and left behind, motionless, looking after them out
      of his narrowing, black-fringed eyes of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ferrall came, and hearing his voice, she raised her colourless face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take me home with you, Kemp, when you take Grace?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I don't know where Grace is. Are you in a hurry to go? It's
      only four o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were at the entrance to the supper-room. Plank drew up a chair for
      her, and she sank down, dropping her elbows on the small table, and
      resting her face between her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pegged out, Sylvia?&rdquo; exclaimed Ferrall incredulously. &ldquo;You? What's the
      younger set coming to?&rdquo; and he motioned a servant to fill her glass. But
      she pushed it aside with a shiver, and gave Plank a strange look which he
      scarcely understood at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More caprices; all sorts of 'em on the programme,&rdquo; muttered Ferrall,
      looking down at her from where he stood beside Plank. &ldquo;O tempora! O
      Sylvia!... Plank, would you mind hunting up my wife? I'll stay and see
      that this infant doesn't fall asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Sylvia shook her head, saying: &ldquo;Please go, Kemp. I'm a little tired,
      that's all. When Grace is ready, I'll leave with her.&rdquo; And at her gesture
      Plank seated himself, while Ferrall, shrugging his square shoulders,
      sauntered off in quest of his wife, stopping a moment at a neighbouring
      table to speak to Agatha Caithness, who sat there with Captain Voucher,
      the gemmed collar on her slender throat a pale blaze of splendour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank was hungry, and he said so in his direct fashion. Sylvia nodded, and
      exchanged a smile with Agatha, who turned at the sound of Plank's voice.
      For a while, as he ate and drank largely, she made the effort to keep up a
      desultory conversation, particularly when anybody to whom she owed an
      explanation hove darkly in sight on the horizon. But Plank's appetite was
      in proportion to the generous lines on which nature had fashioned him, and
      she paid less and less attention to convention and a trifle more to the
      beauty of Agatha's jewels, until the silence at the small table in the
      corner remained unbroken except by the faint tinkle of silver and crystal
      and the bubbling hiss of a glass refilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Belwether, his white, fluffy, chop-whiskers brushed rabbit fashion,
      peeped in at the door, started to tiptoe out again, caught sight of them,
      and came trotting back, beaming rosy effusion. He leaned roguishly over
      the table, his moist eyes a-twinkle with suppressed mirth; then, bestowing
      a sprightly glance on Plank, which said very plainly, &ldquo;I'm up to one of my
      irrepressible jokes again!&rdquo; he held up a smooth, white, and over-manicured
      forefinger:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in Tiffany's yesterday,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I saw a young man in there
      who didn't see me, and I peeped over his shoulder, and what do you think
      he was doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her eyes a little wearily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;He was choosing a collar of blue diamonds and aqua
      marines!&mdash;Te-he!&mdash;probably to wear himself!&mdash;Te-he! Or
      perhaps he was going to be married!&mdash;He-he-he!&mdash;next winter&mdash;ahem!&mdash;next
      November&mdash;Ha-ha! I don't know, I'm sure, what he meant to do with
      that collar. I only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in Sylvia's eyes stopped him, and, following their direction, he
      turned around to find Quarrier standing at his elbow, icy and
      expressionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the aged jester, a little disconcerted, &ldquo;I'm caught talking out
      in church, I see! It was only a harmless little fun, Howard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean you saw me?&rdquo; asked Quarrier, pale as a sheet. &ldquo;You are in
      error. I have not been in Tiffany's in months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Belwether, crestfallen under the white menace of Quarrier's face, nodded,
      and essayed a chuckle without success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia, at first listless and uninterested, looked inquiringly from the
      major to Quarrier, surprised at the suppressed feeling exhibited over so
      trivial a gaucherie. If Quarrier had chosen a collar like Agatha's for
      her, what of it? But as he had not, on his own statement, what did it
      matter? Why should he look that way at the foolish major, to whose
      garrulous gossip he was accustomed, and whose inability to refrain from
      prying was notorious enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning disdainfully, she caught a glimpse of Plank's shocked and altered
      face. It relapsed instantly into the usual inert expression; and a queer,
      uncomfortable perplexity began to invade her. What had happened to stir up
      these three men? Of what importance was an indiscretion of an old
      gentleman whose fatuous vanity and consequent blunders everybody was
      familiar with? And, after all, Howard had not bought anything at
      Tiffany's; he said so himself.... But it was evident that Agatha had
      chanced on the collar that Belwether thought he saw somebody else
      examining.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned, and looked at the dead-white neck of the girl. The collar was
      wonderful&mdash;a miracle of pale fire. And Sylvia, musing, let her
      thoughts run on, dreamy eyes brooding. She was glad that Agatha's means
      permitted her now to have such things. It had been understood, for some
      years, that the Caithness fortune was in rather an alarming condition.
      Howard had been able recently to do a favour or two for old Peter
      Caithness. She had heard the major bragging about it. Evidently Mr.
      Caithness must have improved the chance, if he was able to present such
      gems to his daughter. And now somebody would marry her; perhaps Captain
      Voucher; perhaps even Alderdene; perhaps, as rumour had it now and then,
      Plank might venture into the arena.... Poor Plank! More of a man than
      people understood. She understood. She&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And her thoughts swung back like the returning tide to Siward, and her
      heart began heavily again, and the slightly faint sensation returned. She
      passed her ungloved, unsteady fingers across her eyelids and forehead,
      looking up and around. The major and Howard had disappeared; Plank, beside
      her, sat staring stupidly into his empty wine-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't Mrs. Ferrall coming?&rdquo; she said wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank gathered his cumbersome bulk and stood up, trying to see through the
      entrance into the ball-room. After a moment he said: &ldquo;They're in there,
      talking to Marion. It's a good chance to make our adieux.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they passed out of the supper-room Sylvia paused behind Agatha's chair
      and bent over her. &ldquo;The collar is beautiful,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and so are you,
      Agatha&rdquo;; and with a little impulsive caress for the jewels she passed on,
      unconscious of the delicate flush that spread from Agatha's shoulders to
      her hair. And Agatha, turning, encountered only the stupid gaze of Plank,
      moving ponderously past on Sylvia's heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you'll find Leila, I'm ready at any time,&rdquo; she said carelessly, and
      resumed her tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte with Voucher, who had plainly been annoyed at the
      interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank went on, a new trouble dawning on his thickening mental horizon. He
      had completely forgotten Leila. Even with all the demands made upon him;
      even with all the time he had given to those whose use of him he
      understood, how could he have forgotten Leila and the recent scene between
      them, and the new attitude and new relations with her that he must so
      carefully consider and ponder over before he presented himself at the
      house of Mortimer again!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferrall and his wife and Sylvia were making their adieux to Marion and her
      mother when he came up; and he, too, took that opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, on his quest for Leila, Sylvia, passing through the great hall,
      shrouded in silk and ermine, turned to offer him her hand, saying in a low
      voice: &ldquo;I am at home to you; do you understand? Always,&rdquo; she added
      nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked after her with an unconscious sigh, unaware that anything in
      himself had claimed her respect. And after a moment he swung on his broad
      heels to continue his search for Mrs. Mortimer.

      CHAPTER X THE SEAMY SIDE
    </h2>
    <p>
      About four o'clock on the following afternoon Mrs. Mortimer's maid, who
      had almost finished drying and dressing her mistress' hair, was called to
      the door by a persistent knocking, which at first she had been bidden to
      disregard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mortimer's man, desiring to know whether Mrs. Mortimer could
      receive Mr. Mortimer at once on matters of importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Leila petulantly. &ldquo;Tell Mullins to say that I can not see
      anybody,&rdquo; and catching a glimpse of the shadowy Mullins dodging about the
      dusky corridor: &ldquo;What is the matter? Is Mr. Mortimer ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mullins could not say what the matter might be, and he went away, only
      to return in a few moments bearing a scratchy note from his master, badly
      blotted and still wet; and Leila, with a shrug of resignation, took the
      blotched scrawl daintily between thumb and forefinger and unfolded it.
      Behind her, the maid, twisting up the masses of dark, fragrant hair, read
      the note very easily over her mistress' shoulder. It ran, without
      preliminaries:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to talk to you, whether you like it or not. Do you understand
      that? If you want to know what's the matter with me you'll find out fast
      enough. Fire that French girl out before I arrive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She closed the note thoughtfully, folding and double-folding it into a
      thick wad. The ink had come off, discolouring her finger-tips; she dropped
      the soiled paper on the floor, and held out her hands, plump fingers
      spread. And when the maid had finished removing the stains and had
      repolished the pretty hands, her mistress sipped her chocolate
      thoughtfully, nibbled a bit of dry toast, then motioned the maid to take
      the tray and her departure, leaving her the cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later Mortimer came in, stood a moment blinking around the
      room, then dropped into a seat, sullen, inert, the folds of his chin
      crowded out on his collar, his heavy abdomen cradled on his short, thick
      legs. He had been freshly shaved; linen and clothing were spotless, yet
      the man looked unclean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Save for the network of purple veins in his face, there was no colour
      there, none in his lips; even his flabby hands were the hue of clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo; asked his wife coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not very. I've got the jumps. What's that? Tea? Ugh! it's chocolate.
      Push it out of sight, will you? I can smell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila set the delicate cup on a table behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time did you return this morning?&rdquo; she asked, stifling a yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know; about five or six. How the devil should I know what time I
      came in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sitting there before the mirror of her dresser she stole a second glance
      at his marred features in the glass. The loose mouth, the smeared eyes,
      the palsy-like tremors that twitched the hands where they tightened on the
      arms of his chair, became repulsive to the verge of fascination. She tried
      to look away, but could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better see Dr. Grisby,&rdquo; she managed to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd better see you; that's what I'd better do,&rdquo; he retorted thickly.
      &ldquo;You'll do all the doctoring I want. And I want it, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed his swollen hand across his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;It's the limit, this time, if you want to
      know. I'm all in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roulette?&rdquo; raising her eyebrows without interest
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, roulette, too. Everything! They got me upstairs at Burbank's. The
      game's crooked! Every box, every case, every wheel, every pack is crooked!
      crooked! crooked, by God!&rdquo; he burst out in a fever, struggling to sit
      upright, his hands always tightening on the arms of the chair. &ldquo;It's
      nothing but a creeping joint, run by a bunch of hand-shakers! I&mdash;I'll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stuttering, choking, stammering imprecations, his hoarse clamour died away
      after a while. She sat there, head bent, silent, impassive, acquiescent
      under the physical and mental strain to which she had never become
      thoroughly hardened. How many such scenes had she witnessed! She could not
      count them. They differed very little in detail, and not at all in their
      ultimate object, which was to get what money she had. This was his method
      of reimbursing himself for his losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made an end to his outburst after a while. Only his dreadful fat
      breathing now filled the silence; and supposing he had finished, she found
      her voice with an effort:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry. It comes at a bad time, as you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bad time!&rdquo; he broke out violently. &ldquo;How can it come at any other sort
      of time? With us, all times are bad. If this is worse than the average it
      can't be helped. We are in it for keeps this time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we!&rdquo; he repeated; but his face had grown ghastly, and his uncertain
      eyes were fastened on her's in the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;exactly?&rdquo; she asked, turning from the dresser to
      confront him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no effort to answer; an expression of dull fright was growing on
      his visage, as though for the first time he had begun to realise what had
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw it, and her heart quickened, but she spoke disdainfully: &ldquo;Well, I
      am ready to listen&mdash;as usual. How much do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no sign; his lower lip hung loose; his eyes blinked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;What have you been doing? How much have you
      lost? You can't have lost very much; we hadn't much to lose. If you have
      given your note to any of those gamblers, it is a shame&mdash;a shame!
      Leroy, look at me! You promised me, on your honour, never to do that
      again. Have you lied, after all the times I have helped you out, stripped
      myself, denied myself, put off tradesmen, faced down creditors? After all
      I have done, do you dare come here and ask for more&mdash;ask for what I
      have not got&mdash;with not one bill settled, not one servant paid since
      December&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leila, I&mdash;I've got&mdash;to tell you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; she demanded, appalled by the change in his face. If he was
      overdoing it, he was overdoing it realistically enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I've used Plank's cheque!&rdquo; he mumbled, and moistened his lips
      with his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared back at him, striving to comprehend. &ldquo;Plank's!&rdquo; she repeated
      slowly, &ldquo;Plank's cheque? What cheque? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one he gave you last night. I've used that. Now you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one he&mdash;But you couldn't! How could you? It was not filled in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I filled it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her dawning horror was reacting on him, as it always did, like a fierce
      tonic; and his own courage came back in a sort of sullen desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You... You are trying to frighten me, Leroy,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;You are
      trying to make me do something&mdash;give you what you want&mdash;force me
      to give you what you want! You can't frighten me. The cheque was made out
      to me&mdash;to my order. How could you have used it, if I had not indorsed
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I indorsed it. Do you understand that!&rdquo; he said savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't; because, if you did, it's forgery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't give a damn what you think it is!&rdquo; he broke in fiercely. &ldquo;All I'm
      worried over is what Plank will think. I didn't mean to do it; I didn't
      dream of doing it; but when Burbank cleaned me up I fished about, and that
      cursed cheque came tumbling out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the rising excitement of self-defence the colour was coming back into
      his battered face; he sat up straighter in his chair, and, grasping the
      upholstered arms, leaned forward, speaking more distinctly and with
      increasing vigour and anger:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I saw that cheque in my hands I thought I'd use it temporarily&mdash;merely
      as moral collateral to flash at Burbank&mdash;something to back my I. O.
      U.'s. So I filled it in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For how much?&rdquo; she asked, not daring to believe him; but he ignored the
      question and went on: &ldquo;I filled it and indorsed it, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you indorse it?&rdquo; she interrupted coolly, now unconvinced again
      and suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you if you'll stop that fool tongue a moment. The cheque was
      made to 'L. Mortimer,' wasn't it? So I wrote 'L. Mortimer' on the back.
      Now do you know? If you are L. Mortimer, so am I. Leila begins with L; so
      does Leroy, doesn't it? I didn't imitate your two-words-to-a-page
      autograph. I put my own fist to a cheque made out to one L. Mortimer; and
      I don't care what you think about it as long as Plank can stand it. Now
      put up your nose and howl, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But under her sudden pallor he was taking fright again, and he began to
      bolster up his courage with bluster and noise, as usual:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howl all you like!&rdquo; he jeered. &ldquo;It won't alter matters or square accounts
      with Plank. What are you staring at? Do you suppose I'm not sorry? Do you
      fancy I don't know what a fool I've been? What are you turning white for?
      What in hell&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much have you&mdash;&rdquo; She choked, then, resolutely: &ldquo;How much have
      you&mdash;taken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taken!&rdquo; he broke out, with an oath. &ldquo;What do you mean? I've borrowed
      about twenty thousand dollars. Now yelp! Eh? What?&mdash;no yelps?
      Probably some weeps, then. Turn 'em on and run dry; I'll wait.&rdquo; And he
      managed to cross one bulky leg over the other and lean back, affecting
      resignation, while Leila, bolt upright in her low chair, every curved
      outline rigid under the flowing, silken wrap, stared at him as though
      stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we're good for it, aren't we?&rdquo; he said threateningly. &ldquo;If he's
      going to turn ugly about it, here's the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My&mdash;house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your house! I suppose you'd rather raise something on the house than
      have the thing come out in the papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; she asked, staring into his bloodshot eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do. I'm damn sure of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that you are not inclined to stand by me?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I mean that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't intend to help me out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not intend to&mdash;not this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to show his big teeth, and that nervous snickering &ldquo;tick&rdquo;
       twitched his upper lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the courts?&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;Do you want to figure in them with
      Plank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to,&rdquo; she said steadily, &ldquo;but you can not frighten me any
      more by that threat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Can't frighten you! Perhaps you think you'll marry Plank when I get a
      decree? Do you? Well, you won't for several reasons; first, because I'll
      name other corespondents and that will make Plank sick; second, because
      Plank wants to marry somebody else and I'm able to assist him. So where do
      you come out in the shuffle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; she said, under her breath, and rested her head against
      the back of the chair, as though suddenly tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know. You'll come out smirched, and you know it,&rdquo; said Mortimer,
      gazing intently at her. &ldquo;Look here, Leila: I didn't come here to threaten
      you. I'm no black-mailer; I'm no criminal. I'm simply a decent sort of a
      man, who is pretty badly scared over what he's done in a moment of
      temptation. You know I had no thought of anything except to borrow enough
      on my I. O. U.'s to make a killing at Burbank's. I had to show them
      something big, so I filled in that cheque, not meaning to use it; and
      before I knew it I'd indorsed it, and was plunging against it. Then they
      stacked everything on me&mdash;by God, they did! and if I had not been in
      the condition I was in I'd have stopped payment. But it was too late when
      I realised what I was against. Leila, you know I'm not a bad man at heart.
      Can't you help a fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His manner, completely changed, had become the resentful and fretful
      appeal of the victim of plot and circumstance. All the savage brutality
      had been eliminated; the sneer, the truculent attempts to browbeat, the
      pitiful swagger, the cynical justification, all were gone. It was really
      the man himself now, normally scared and repentant; the frightened,
      overfed pensioner on his wife's bounty; not the human beast maddened by
      fear and dissipation, half stunned, half panic-stricken, driven by sheer
      terror into a rÃ´le which even he shrank from&mdash;had shrunk from all
      these years. For, leech and parasite that he was, Mortimer, however much
      the dirty acquisition of money might tempt him in theory, had not yet
      brought himself to the point of attempting the practice, even when in
      sorest straits and bitterest need. He didn't want to do it; he wished to
      get along without it, partly because of native inertia and an aversion to
      the mental nimbleness that he would be required to show as a law-breaker,
      partly because the word &ldquo;black-mail&rdquo; stood for what he did not dare
      suggest that he had come to, even to himself. His distaste was genuine;
      there were certain things which he didn't want to commit, and extortion
      was one of them. He could, at a pinch, lie to his wife, or try to scare
      her into giving him money; he could, when necessary, &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; from such
      men as Plank; but he had never cheated at cards, and he had never
      attempted to black-mail anybody except his wife&mdash;which, of course,
      was purely a family matter, and concerned nobody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he was attempting it again, with more sincerity, energy, and
      determination than he ever before had been forced to display. Even in his
      most profane violence the rage and panic were only partly real. He was, it
      is true, genuinely scared, and horribly shaken physically, but he had
      counted on violence, and he stimulated his own emotions and made them
      serve him, knowing all the while that in the reaction his ends would be
      accomplished, as usual. This policy of alternately frightening,
      dragooning, and supplicating Leila had carried him so far; and though it
      was true that this was a more serious situation than he had ever yet
      faced, he was convinced that his wife would pull him out somehow; and how
      that was to be accomplished he did not very much care, as long as he was
      pulled out safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What this household requires,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is economy.&rdquo; He spread his legs,
      denting the Aubusson carpet with his boot-heels, and glanced askance at
      his wife. &ldquo;Economy,&rdquo; he repeated, furtively wetting his lips with a
      heavily coated tongue; &ldquo;that's the true solution; economical
      administration in domestic matters. Retrenchment, Leila! retrenchment!
      Fewer folderols. I've a notion to give up that farm, and stop trying to
      breed those damfool sheep. They cost a thousand apiece, and do you know
      what I got for those six I sent to Westbury? Just twelve hundred dollars
      from Fleetwood&mdash;the bargaining shopkeeper! Twelve hundred! Think of
      that! And along comes Granby and sells a single ram for six thousand
      plunks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila's head was lowered. He could not see her expression, but he had
      always been confident of his ability to talk himself out of trouble, so he
      rambled on in pretence of camaraderie, currying favour, as he believed,
      ingratiating himself with the coarse bluntness that served him among some
      men, even among some women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll fix it somehow,&rdquo; he said reassuringly; &ldquo;don't you worry, Leila.
      I've confidence in you, little girl! You've got me out of sticky messes
      before, eh? Well, we've weathered a few, haven't we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even the horrible parody on wedded loyalty left her silent, unmoved, dark
      eyes brooding; and he began to grow a little restless and anxious as his
      jocularity increased without a movement in either response or aversion
      from his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't be scared, if I'm not,&rdquo; he said reproachfully. &ldquo;The house is
      worth two hundred and fifty thousand, and there's only fifty on it now. If
      that fat, Dutch skinflint, Plank, shows his tusks, we can clap on another
      fifty.&rdquo; And as she made no sound or movement in reply: &ldquo;As far as Plank
      goes, haven't I done enough for him to square it? What have we ever got
      out of him, except a thousand or two now and then when the cards went
      against me? If I took it, it was practically what he owes me. And if he
      thinks it's too much&mdash;look here, Leila! I've a trick up my sleeve. I
      can make good any time I wish to. I'm in a position to marry that man to
      the girl he's mad about&mdash;stark, raving mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mortimer slowly raised her head and looked at her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leroy, are you mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! Not much!&rdquo; he exclaimed gleefully. &ldquo;I can make him the husband of the
      most-run-after girl in New York&mdash;if I want to. And at the same time I
      can puncture the most arrogant, the most cold-blooded, selfish,
      purse-proud, inflated nincompoop that ever sat at the head of a director's
      table. O-ho! Now you're staring, Leila. I can do it; I can make good. What
      are you worrying about? Why, I've got a hundred ways to square that
      cheque, and each separate way is a winner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose, shook out the creases in his trousers, and adjusted the squat,
      gold fob which ornamented his protruding waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you'll fix it, won't you, Leila?&rdquo; he said, apparently oblivious that
      he had expressed himself as able to adjust the matter in one hundred
      equally edifying and satisfactory manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer. He lingered a moment at the door, looking back with an
      ingratiating leer; but she paid him no attention, and he took himself off,
      confident that her sulkiness could not result in anything unpleasant to
      anybody except herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did it, as far as he could see. The days brought no noticeable change
      in his wife's demeanour toward him. Plank, when he met him, was civil
      enough, though it did occur to Mortimer that he saw very little of Plank
      in these days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ungrateful beggar!&rdquo; he thought bitterly; &ldquo;he's toadying to Belwether now.
      I can't do anything more for him, so I don't interest him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And for a while he wore either a truculent, aggrieved air in Plank's
      presence, or the meeker demeanour of a martyr, sentimentally
      misunderstood, but patient under the affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there came a time when he needed money. During the few days he spent
      circling tentatively and apprehensively around his wife he learned enough
      to know that there was nothing to be had from her at present. No doubt the
      money she raised to placate Plank&mdash;if she had placated him in that
      fashion&mdash;was a strain on her resources, whatever those resources
      were.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing was certain: Plank had not remained very long in ignorance of
      the cheque drawn against his balance, if indeed, as Mortimer feared, the
      bank itself had not communicated with Plank as soon as the cheque was
      presented for payment. Therefore Plank must have been placated by Leila;
      how, Mortimer was satisfied not to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of these days,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I'll catch her tripping, and
      then there'll be a decent division of property, or&mdash;there'll be a
      divorce.&rdquo; But, as usual, Mortimer found such practices more attractive in
      theory than in execution, and he was really quite contented to go on as
      things were going, if somebody would see that he had some money
      occasionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these occasions when he needed it was approaching. He had made a
      &ldquo;killing&rdquo; at Desmond's, and had used the money to stop up the more
      threatening gaps in the tottering financial fabric known as his &ldquo;personal
      accounts.&rdquo; The fabric would hold for a while, but meantime he needed money
      to go on with. And Leila evidently had none. He tried everybody except
      Plank. He had scarcely the impudence to go to Plank just yet; but when,
      completing the vicious circle, he found his borrowing capacity exhausted,
      and himself once more face to face with the only hope, Plank, he sat down
      to consider seriously the possibility of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Plank owed him more than he could ever pay&mdash;the ungrateful
      parvenu!&mdash;but what Plank had thought of that cheque transaction he
      had never been able to discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow or other he must put Plank under fresh obligations; and that might
      have been possible had not Leila invaded the ground, leaving nothing, now
      that Plank was secure in club life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the first thing that presented itself to Mortimer's
      consideration was the engineering of Plank's matrimonial ambitions.
      Clearly the man had not changed. He was always at Sylvia's heels; he was
      seen with her in public; he went to the Belwether house a great deal. No
      possible doubt but that he was as infatuated as ever. And Quarrier was
      going to marry her next November&mdash;that is, if he, Mortimer, chose to
      keep silent about a certain midnight episode at Shotover.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his inclination, except in theory, to keep silent, partly because
      of his native inertia and unwillingness to go to the physical and
      intellectual exertion of being a rascal, partly because he didn't really
      want to be a rascal of that sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a man with premonitions of toothache, who walks down to the dentist's
      just to see what the number of the house looks like, and then walks around
      the block to think it over, so Mortimer, suffering from lack of money,
      walked round and round the central idea, unable to bring himself to the
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several times he called up Quarrier on the 'phone and made appointments to
      lunch with him; but these meetings never resulted in anything except
      luncheons which Mortimer paid for, and matters were becoming desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      So one day, after having lunched too freely, he sat down and wrote Plank
      the following note:
    </p>
    <p>
      My Dear Beverly: You will remember that I once promised you my aid in
      securing what, to you, is the dearest object of your existence. I have
      thought, I have pondered, I have given the matter deep and, I may add
      without irreverence, prayerful consideration, knowing that the life's
      happiness of my closest friend depended on my judgment and wisdom and
      intelligence to secure for him the opportunity to crown his life's work by
      the acquisition of the brightest jewel in the diadem of old Manhattan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George! that's wickedly good, though!&rdquo; chuckled Mortimer, refreshing
      himself with his old stand-by, an apple, quartered, and soaked in very old
      port. So he sopped his apple and swallowed it, and picked up his pen
      again, chary of overdoing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All I say to you is, be ready! The time is close at hand when you may
      boldly make your avowal. But be ready! All depends upon the psychological
      moment. An instant too soon, an instant too late, and you are lost. And
      she is lost forever. Remember! Be faithful; trust in me, and wait. And the
      instant I say, &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; pour out your soul, my dear friend, and be certain
      you are not pouring it out in vain. L. M.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing about &ldquo;pouring out&rdquo; made him thirsty, so he fortified himself
      several times, and then, sealing the letter, went out to a letter-box and
      stood looking at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I mail it I'm in for it,&rdquo; he muttered. After a while he put the letter
      in his pocket and walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It really doesn't commit me to anything,&rdquo; he reflected at last, halting
      before another letter-box. And as he stood there, hesitating, he glanced
      up and saw Quarrier entering the Lenox Club. The next moment he flung up
      the metal box lid, dropped in his letter, and followed Quarrier into the
      club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then events tumbled forward almost without a push from him. Quarrier was
      alone in a window corner, drinking vichy and milk and glancing over the
      afternoon papers. He saw Mortimer, and invited him to join him; and
      Mortimer, being thirsty, took champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been trying a new coach,&rdquo; said Quarrier, in his colourless and
      rather agreeable voice; and he went on leisurely explaining the points of
      the new mail-coach which had been built in Paris after plans of his own,
      while Mortimer gulped glass after glass of chilled wine, which seemed only
      to make him thirstier. Meantime he listened, really interested, except
      that his fleshy head was too full of alcohol and his own project to
      contain additional statistics concerning coaching. Besides, Quarrier, who
      had never been over-cordial to him, was more so now&mdash;enough for
      Mortimer to venture on a few tentative suggestions of a financial nature;
      and though, as usual, Quarrier was not responsive, he did not, as usual,
      get up and go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A vague hope stirred Mortimer that it might not be beyond his persuasive
      tongue to make this chilly, reticent young man into a friend some day&mdash;a
      helpful friend. For Mortimer all his life had trusted to his tongue; and
      though poorly enough repaid, the few lingual victories remained in his
      memory, along with an inexhaustible vanity and hope; while his countless
      defeats and the many occasions on which his tongue had played him false
      were all forgotten. Besides, he had been drinking more heavily all day
      than was his custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Quarrier talked, sparingly, about his new coach, about Billy
      Fleetwood's renowned string of hunters, about Ashley Spencer's new stable
      and his chances at Saratoga with Roy-a-neh, for which he had paid a
      fabulous sum&mdash;the sum and the story probably equally fabulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer's head was swimming with ideas; he was also talking a great deal,
      much more than he had intended; he was saying things he had not exactly
      intended to say, either, in just that way. He realised it, but he went on,
      unable to stop his own tongue, the noise of which intoxicated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice he thought Quarrier looked at him rather strangely; but he
      would show Quarrier that he was nobody's fool; he'd show Quarrier that he
      was a friend, a good, staunch friend; and that Quarrier had long, long
      undervalued him. Waves of sentiment spread through and through him; his
      affection for Quarrier dampened his eyes; and still he blabbed on and on,
      gazing with brimming eyes upon Quarrier, who sat back silent and attentive
      as Mortimer circled and blundered nearer and nearer to the crucial point
      of his destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midway in one of his linguistic ellipses Quarrier leaned forward and
      caught his arm in a grip of steel. Another man had entered the room.
      Mortimer, made partly conscious by the pain of Quarrier's vise-like grip,
      was sober enough to recognise the impropriety of his continuing aloud the
      veiled story he had been constructing with what he supposed to be a
      cunning as matchless as it was impenetrable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later he found himself upstairs in a private card-room, facing Quarrier
      across a table, and still talking and quenching his increasing thirst. He
      knew now what he was telling Quarrier; he was unveiling the parable; he
      was stripping metaphor from a carefully precise story. He used Siward's
      name presently; presently he used Sylvia's name. A moment later&mdash;or
      was it an hour?&mdash;Quarrier stopped him, coldly, without a trace of
      passion, demanding corroborative detail. And Mortimer gave it, wagging his
      head and one fat forefinger as emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw that?&rdquo; repeated Quarrier, deadly white of a sudden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; an' I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At three in the morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; an' I want&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw him enter her room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; an' I wan' tersay thish to you, because I'm your fr'en'. Don' wan'
      anny fr'en's mine get fooled on women! See? Thash how I feel. I respec'
      the sect! See! Women, lovely women! See? Respec' sect! Gimme y'han',
      buzzer&mdash;er&mdash;brother Quar'er! Your m' fr'en'; I'm your fr'en'. I
      know how it is. Gotter wife m'own. Rotten one. Stingy! Takes money outter
      m' pockets. Dam 'stravagant. Ruin me!... Say, old boy, what about dividend
      due 'morrow on Orange County Eclectic&mdash;mean Erlextic&mdash;no!&mdash;mean
      'Letric! Damn!&mdash;Wasser masser tongue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Opening his fond and foggy eyes, and finding himself alone in the
      card-room, he began to cry; and a little later, attempting to push the
      electric button, he fell over a lounge and lay there, his shirt-front
      soiled with wine, one fat leg trailing to the floor; not the ideal
      position for slumber, perhaps, but what difference do attitudes and
      postures and poses make when a gentleman, in the sacred seclusion of his
      own club, is wooing the drowsy goddess with blasts of votive music through
      his empurpled nose?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, however, he was due to dine at the Belwether house; and
      when eight o'clock approached, and he had not returned to dress, Leila
      called up Sylvia Landis on the telephone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, Leroy hasn't returned, and I suppose he's forgotten about the
      Bridge. I can bring Mr. Plank, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Sylvia, adding, &ldquo;if Mr. Plank is there, may I speak to
      him a moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Leila rose, setting the receiver on the desk, and Plank came in from
      the library and settled himself heavily in the chair:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you wish to speak to me, Miss Landis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Mr. Plank? Yes; will you dine with us at eight? Bridge
      afterward, if you don't mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, Mr. Plank, you had a note from me this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please disregard it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. It is not worth while.&rdquo; And as Plank made no comment, &ldquo;I have no
      further interest in the matter. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Plank doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing more to say. I am sorry. We dine at eight,&rdquo; concluded
      Sylvia hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank hung up the receiver and sat eyeing it for a while in silence. Then
      his jaw began to harden and his under lip protruded, and he folded his
      great hands, resting them in front of him on the edge of the desk,
      brooding there, with eyes narrowing like a sleepy giant at prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Leila entered, in her evening wraps, she found him there, so immersed
      in reverie that he failed to hear her; and she stood a moment at the
      doorway, smiling to herself, thinking how pleasant it was to come down
      ready for the evening and find him there, as though he belonged where he
      sat, and was part of the familiar environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently she had grown younger in a smooth-skinned, full-lipped way&mdash;so
      much younger that it was spoken of. Something girlish in figure, in
      spontaneity, in the hesitation of her smile, in the lack of that hard,
      brilliant confidence which once characterised her, had developed; as
      though she were beginning her dÃ©but again, reverting to a softness and
      charm prematurely checked. Truly, her youth's discoloured blossom, forced
      by the pale phantom of false spring, was refolding to a bud once more; and
      the harsher tints of the inclement years were fading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beverly,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank stood up, dazed from his reverie, and walked toward her. His white
      tie had become disarranged; she raised her hands, halting him, and pulled
      it into shape for him, consciously innocent of the intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you know how pretty you are this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I was very happy at my mirror. Do you know, the withered years seem
      to be dropping from me like leaves from an autumn sapling. And I feel
      young enough to say so poetically.... Did Sylvia try to flirt with you
      over the wire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, as usual,&rdquo; he said drily, descending the stairs beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And really you don't love her any more?&rdquo; she queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely.&rdquo; His voice was low and rather disagreeable, and she looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I knew what you and Sylvia find to talk about so frequently, if
      you're not in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he made no answer; and they drove away to the Belwether house, a
      rather wide, old-style mansion of brown stone, with a stoop dividing its
      ugly faÃ§ade, and a series of unnecessary glass doors blockading the
      vestibule.
    </p>
    <p>
      A drawing-room and a reception-room flanked the marble-tiled hall; behind
      these the dining-room ran the width of the rear. It was a typical
      gentlefolk's house of the worst period of Manhattan, and Major Belwether
      belonged in it as fittingly as a melodeon belongs in a west-side flat. The
      hall-way was made for such a man as he to patter through; the
      velvet-covered stairs were as peculiarly fitted for him as a runway is for
      a rabbit; the suave pink-and-white drawing-room, the discreet, gray
      reception-room, the soft, fat rugs, the intricacies of banisters and
      alcoves and curtained cubby-holes&mdash;all reflected his personality, all
      corroborated the ensemble. It was his habitat, his distinctly, from the
      pronounced but meaningless intricacy of the architecture to the studied
      but unconvincing tints, like a man who suddenly starts to speak, but
      checks himself, realising he has nothing in particular to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were half a dozen people there lounging informally between the
      living-room on the second floor and Sylvia's apartments in the rear&mdash;the
      residue from a luncheon and Bridge party given that afternoon by Sylvia to
      a score or so of card-mad women. A few of these she had asked to remain
      for an informal dinner, and a desperate game later&mdash;the sort of
      people she knew well enough to lose to heavily or win from without remorse&mdash;Grace
      Ferrall, Marion Page, Agatha Caithness. Trusting to the telephone that
      morning, she had secured the Mortimers and Quarrier, failing three men;
      and now the party, with Plank as Mortimer's substitute, was complete, all
      thorough gamesters&mdash;sex mattering nothing in the preparation for such
      a sÃ©ance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Sylvia's boudoir Grace Ferrall and Agatha Caithness sat before the
      fire; Sylvia, at the mirror of her dresser, was correcting the pallor
      incident to the unbroken dissipation of a brilliant season; Marion, with
      her inevitable cigarette, wandered between Sylvia's quarters and the
      library, where Quarrier and Major Belwether were sitting in low-voiced
      confab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leila, greeted gaily from the boudoir, went in. Plank entered the library,
      was mauled effusively by the major, returned Quarrier's firm hand shake,
      and sat down with an inquiring smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, we're out for blood to-night,&rdquo; tittered Major Belwether,
      grasping Quarrier's arm humourously and shaking it to emphasise his words&mdash;a
      habit that Quarrier thoroughly disliked. &ldquo;Sylvia had a lot of women here
      playing for the season score, so I suggested she keep the pick of them for
      dinner, and call in a few choice ones to make a night of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's agreeable to me,&rdquo; said Plank, still looking at Quarrier with the
      same inquiring expression, which that gentleman presently chose to
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't had a chance to look into that matter,&rdquo; he said carelessly.
      &ldquo;Some day, when you have time to go over it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have time now,&rdquo; said Plank; &ldquo;there's nothing to go over; there's no
      reason for any secrecy. All I wrote you was that I proposed to control the
      stock of Amalgamated Electric and that I wished your advice in the
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not give you any advice off-hand on such an extraordinary
      suggestion,&rdquo; returned Quarrier coldly. &ldquo;If you know where the stock is,
      you'll understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean what it is quoted at, or who owns it?&rdquo; interrupted Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who owns it. Everybody knows where it has dropped to, I suppose. Most
      people know, too, where it is held.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is manipulating it,&rdquo; added Quarrier indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean Harrington's people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean anybody in particular, Mr. Plank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Plank, staring, &ldquo;I was sure you couldn't have meant Harrington;
      because,&rdquo; he went on deliberately, &ldquo;there are other theories floating
      about that mysterious pool, one of which I've proved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier looked at him out of his velvety-lidded eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you proved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you, if you'll appoint an interview.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll come too,&rdquo; began Belwether, who had been listening, loose-mouthed
      and intent; &ldquo;we're all in it&mdash;Howard, Kemp Ferrall, and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Stephen Siward,&rdquo; observed Plank, so quietly that Quarrier never even
      raised his eyes to read the stolid face opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he said: &ldquo;Do you know anybody who can deliver you any
      considerable block of Amalgamated Electric at the market figures?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could deliver you several blocks, if you care to bid,&rdquo; said Plank
      bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Belwether grew red, then pale. Quarrier stiffened in his chair, but his
      eyes were only sceptical. Plank's under lip had begun to protrude again;
      he swung his massive head, looking from Belwether back to Quarrier:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pool or no pool,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you Amalgamated people will want to see
      the stock climb back into the branches from which somebody shook it out;
      and I propose to put it there. That is all I had meant to say to you, Mr.
      Quarrier. I'm not averse to saying it here to you, and I do. There's no
      secrecy about it. Figure out for yourself how much stock I control, and
      who let it go. Settle your family questions and put your house in order;
      then invite me to call, and I'll do it. And I have an idea that we are
      going to stand on our own legs again, and recover our self-respect and our
      fighting capacity; and I rather think we'll stop this hold-up business,
      and that our Inter-County friend will let go the sand-bag and pocket the
      jimmy, and talk business across the line-fence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier's characteristic pallor was no index to his feelings, nor was his
      icy reticence. All hell might be boiling below.
    </p>
    <p>
      When anybody gave Quarrier a letter to read he took a long time reading
      it; but if he was slow he was also minute; he went over every word again
      and again, studying, absorbing each letter, each period, the conformation
      of every word. And when he ended he had in his brain a photograph of the
      letter which he would never forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, slowly, minutely, methodically, he was going over and over
      Plank's words, and his manner of saying them, and their surface import,
      and the hidden one, if any.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Plank had spoken the truth&mdash;and there was no reason to doubt it&mdash;Plank
      had quietly acquired a controlling interest in Amalgamated Electric. That
      meant treachery in somebody. Who? Probably Siward, perhaps Belwether. He
      would not look at the latter just yet; not for a minute or two. There was
      time enough to see through that withered, pink-and-white old fraud. But
      why had Plank done this? And why did Plank suspect him of any desire to
      wreck his own property? He did suspect him, that was certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a silence, he spoke quietly and without emotion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody concerned will be glad to see Amalgamated Electric declaring
      dividends. This is a shock to us,&rdquo; he glanced impassively at the shrunken
      major, &ldquo;but a pleasant shock. I think it well to arrange a meeting as soon
      as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said Plank, with a manner of closing discussion. And in his
      brusque ending of the matter Quarrier detected the ringing undertone of an
      authority he never had and never would endure; and though his pale,
      composed features betrayed not the subtlest shade of emotion, he was aware
      that a new element had come into his life&mdash;a new force was growing
      out of nothing to confront him, an unfamiliar shape loomed vaguely ahead,
      throwing its huge distorted shadow across his path. He sensed it with the
      instinct of kind for kind, not because Plank's millions meant anything to
      him as a force; not because this lumbering, red-faced meddler had
      blundered into a family affair where confidence consisted in joining hands
      lest a pocket be inadvertently picked; not because Plank had knocked at
      the door, expecting treachery to open, and had found it, but because of
      the awful simplicity of the man and his methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Plank suspected him, he must also suspect him of complicity in the
      Inter-County grab; he must suspect him of the ruthless crushing power that
      corrupts or annihilates opposition, making a mockery of legislation, a
      jest of the courts, and an epigram of a people's indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, in the face of all this, careless, fearless, frank to the outer
      verge of stupidity&mdash;which sometimes means the inability to be afraid&mdash;this
      man Plank was casually telling him things which men regard as secrets and
      as weapons of defence&mdash;was actually averting him of his peril, and
      telling him almost contemptuously to pull up the drawbridge and prepare
      for siege, instead of rushing the castle and giving it to the sack.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Quarrier sat there meditating, his long, white fingers caressing his
      soft, pointed beard, Sylvia came in, greeting the men collectively with a
      nod, and offering her hand to Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinner is announced,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;please go in farm fashion. Wait!&rdquo; as
      Plank, following the major and Quarrier, stood aside for her to pass. &ldquo;No,
      you go ahead, Howard; and you,&rdquo; to the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left for a moment in the room with Plank, she stood listening to the
      others descending the stairs; then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen Mr. Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Is he well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he well enough to read a letter, and to answer one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; he's well enough in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I supposed so. That is why I said to you, over the wire, not to trouble
      him with my request.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that I am not to say anything about your offer to buy the
      hunter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. If I make up my mind that I want the horse I'll write him&mdash;perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lingering still, she let one hand fall on the banisters, turning back
      toward Plank, who was following:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood you to mean that&mdash;that Mr. Siward's financial affairs
      were anything but satisfactory?&rdquo;&mdash;the sweet, trailing, upward
      inflection making it a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did I say that?&rdquo; demanded Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once&mdash;a month ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't,&rdquo; said Plank bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I had inferred it, then, from something you said, or something you
      were silent about. Is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I quite wrong, then?&rdquo; she asked, looking him in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Plank, who never lied, found no answer. Considering him for a moment
      in silence, she turned again and descended the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was one of those thoroughly well-chosen dinners of few courses
      and faultless service suitable for card-players, who neither care to stuff
      themselves as a preliminary to a battle royal, nor to dawdle through
      courses, eliminating for themselves what is not good for them. The men
      drank a light, sound, aromatic Irish of the major's; the women&mdash;except
      Marion, who took what the men took&mdash;used claret sparingly. Coffee was
      served where they sat; the men smoking, Agatha and Marion producing their
      own cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you smoke any more?&rdquo; asked Grace Ferrall of Leila Mortimer, and at
      the smiling negative, &ldquo;Oh, that perhaps explains it. You're growing
      positively radiant, you know. You'll he wearing a braid and a tuck in your
      skirt if you go on getting younger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila laughed, colouring up as Plank turned in his chair to look at her
      closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it won't rub off, Mr. Plank,&rdquo; said Marion coolly, &ldquo;but mine will.
      This,&rdquo; touching a faint spot of colour under her eyes, &ldquo;is art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! I'm all art!&rdquo; said Grace. &ldquo;Observe, Mr. Plank, that under this
      becoming flush are the same old freckles you saw at Shotover.&rdquo; And she
      laughed that sweet, careless laugh of an adolescent and straightened her
      boyish figure, pretty head held high, adding: &ldquo;Kemp won't let me 'improve'
      myself, or I'd do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are perfect,&rdquo; said Sylvia, rising from the table, her own lovely,
      rounded, youthful figure condoning the exaggeration; &ldquo;you're sufficiently
      sweet as you are. Good people, if you are ready, we will go through the
      ceremony of cutting for partners&mdash;unless otherwise you decide. How
      say you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care to enter the scramble for a man,&rdquo; cried Grace. &ldquo;If it's to
      choose, I'd as soon choose Marion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank looked at Leila, who laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; choose, then!&rdquo; said Sylvia. &ldquo;Howard, you're dying, of course,
      to play with me, but you're looking very guiltily at Agatha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The major asked Leila at once; so Plank fell to Sylvia, pitted against
      Marion and Grace Ferrall.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later the quiet of the library was broken by the butler
      entering with decanters and ice, and glasses that tinkled frostily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Play began at table Number One on a passed make of no trumps by Sylvia,
      and at the other table on a doubled and redoubled heart make, which sent a
      delicate flush into Agatha's face, and drove the last vestige of lingering
      thoughtfulness from Quarrier's, leaving it a tense, pallid, and
      expressionless mask, out of which looked the velvet-fringed eyes of a
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the faces there at the two tables, Sylvia's alone had not changed,
      neither assuming the gambler's mask nor the infatuated glare of the
      amateur. She was thoughtful, excited, delighted, or dismayed by turns, but
      always wholesomely so; the game for its own sake, and not the stakes,
      absorbing her, partly because she had never permitted herself to weigh
      money and pleasure in the same balance, but kept a mental pair of scales
      for each.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual, the fever of gain was fiercest in those who could afford to lose
      most. Quarrier, playing to rule with merciless precision, coldly exacted
      every penalty that a lapse in his opponents permitted. Agatha, her teeth
      set in her nether lip, her eyes like living jewels, answered Quarrier's
      every signal, interpreted every sign, her play fitting in exactly with
      his, as though she were his subconscious self balancing the perfectly
      adjusted mechanism of his body and mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then lifting her eyes, she sent a long, limpid glance at Quarrier
      like a pale shaft of light; and under his heavy-fringed lashes, at
      moments, his level gaze encountered her's with a slow narrowing of lids&mdash;as
      though there was more than one game in progress, more than one stake being
      played for under the dull rose glow of the clustered lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia, sitting dummy at the other tables mechanically alert to Plank's
      cards dropping in rapid sequence as he played alternately from his own
      hand and the dummy, permitted her thoughtful eyes to wander toward Agatha
      from moment to moment. How alluring her subtle beauty, in its own strange
      way! How perfect her accord with her partner! How faultless her
      intelligence, divining the very source of every hidden motive controlling
      him, forestalling his intent&mdash;acquiescent, delicate, marvellous
      intelligence&mdash;the esoteric complement of two parts of a single mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The collar of diamonds and aqua marines shimmered like the reflection of
      shadowy lightning across her throat; a single splendid jewel glowed on her
      left hand as her fingers flashed among the cards for the make-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred aces,&rdquo; broke in Plank's heavy voice as he played the last trick
      and picked up the scoring card and pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia's blue eyes were laughing as Plank cut the new pack. Marion Page
      coolly laid aside her cigarette, dealt, and made it &ldquo;without&rdquo; in the
      original.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I play?&rdquo; asked Sylvia sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please,&rdquo; growled Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Sylvia serenely played from the &ldquo;top of nothing,&rdquo; and Grace Ferrall
      whisked a wonderful dummy across the green; and Plank's thick under lip
      began to protrude, and he lowered his heavy head like a bull at bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once Marion, over-intent, touched a card in the dummy when she should have
      played from her own hand; and Sylvia would have let it pass, had not Plank
      calmly noted the penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! It's too much like business,&rdquo; sighed Sylvia. &ldquo;Can't we play for
      the sake of the sport? I don't think it good sportsmanship to profit by a
      blunder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rule,&rdquo; observed Marion laconically. &ldquo;'Ware barbed wire, if you want the
      brush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I myself never was crazy for the brush,&rdquo; murmured Sylvia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace whispered maliciously: &ldquo;But you've got it, with the mask and pads,&rdquo;
       and her mischievous head barely tipped backward in the direction of
      Quarrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially the mask,&rdquo; returned Sylvia, under her breath, and laid on the
      table the last card of a Yarborough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank scored without comment. Marion cut, and resumed her cigarette.
      Sylvia dealt with that witchery of rounded wrists and slim fingers
      fascinating to men and women alike. Then, cards en rÃ¨gle, passed the make.
      Plank, cautiously consulting the score, made it spades, which being
      doubled, Grace led a &ldquo;singleton&rdquo; ace, and Plank slapped down a strong
      dummy and folded his great arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward midnight, Sylvia, absorbed in her dummy, fancied she heard the
      electric bell ringing at the front door. Later, having barely made the
      odd, she was turning to look at the major, when, beyond him, she saw Leroy
      Mortimer enter the room, sullen, pasty-skinned, but perfectly sober and
      well groomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a trifle late,&rdquo; observed Sylvia carelessly. Grace Ferrall and
      Marion ignored him. Plank bade him good evening in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people at the other table, having completed their rubber, looked
      around at Mortimer in disagreeable surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll cut in, if you want me. If you don't, say so,&rdquo; observed Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was plain that they did not; so he settled himself in an arm-chair,
      with an ugly glance at his wife and an insolent one at Quarrier; and the
      game went on in silence; Leila and the major still losing heavily under
      the sneering gaze of Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, &ldquo;Who's carrying you?&rdquo; he broke out, exasperated; and in the
      shocked silence Leila, very white, made a movement to rise, but Quarrier
      laid his long fingers across her arm, pressing her backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know what you're saying,&rdquo; he remarked, looking coldly at
      Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank laid down his cards, rose, and walked over to Mortimer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I have a word with you?&rdquo; he asked bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may. And I'll help myself to a word or two with you,&rdquo; retorted
      Mortimer, following Plank out of the room, down the stairs to the lighted
      reception-room, where they wheeled, confronting one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; demanded Plank. &ldquo;At the club they told me you were
      asleep in the card-room. I didn't tell Leila. What is wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm&mdash;I'm dead broke,&rdquo; said Mortimer harshly. &ldquo;Billy Fleetwood took
      my paper. Can you help me out? It's due to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank looked at him gravely, but made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you?&rdquo; repeated Mortimer violently. &ldquo;Haven't I done enough for you?
      Haven't I done enough for everybody? Is anybody going to show me any
      consideration? Look at Quarrier's manner to me just now! And this very day
      I did him a service that all his millions can't repay. And there you
      stand, too, staring at me as though I were some damned importuning
      shabby-genteel, hinting around for an opening to touch you. Yes, you do!
      And this very day I have done for you the&mdash;the most vital thing&mdash;the
      most sacred favour one man can do for another&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He halted, stammered something incoherent, his battered eyes wet with
      tears. The man was a wreck&mdash;nerves, stamina, mind on the very verge
      of collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll help you, of course,&rdquo; said Plank, eyeing him. &ldquo;Go home, now, and
      sleep. I tell you I'll help you in the morning.... Don't give way! Have
      you no grit? Pull up sharp, I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mortimer had fallen into a chair, his ravaged face cradled in his
      hands. &ldquo;I've got all that's c-coming to me,&rdquo; he said hoarsely; &ldquo;I'm all in&mdash;all
      in! God! but I've got the jumps this trip.... You'll stand for this, won't
      you, Plank? I was batty, but I woke up in time to grasp the live wire
      Billy Fleetwood held&mdash;three shocks in succession&mdash;and his were
      queens full to my jacks&mdash;aces to kings twice!&mdash;Alderdene and
      Voucher sitting in until they'd started me off hiking hellward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to ramble, and even to laugh weakly, passing his puffy, shaking
      hands across his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's good of you, Beverly; I appreciate it. But I've been good to you.
      You're all to the good, my boy! Understand? All to the good. I fixed it; I
      did it for you. You can have your innings now. You can have her when you
      want her, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Plank menacingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean! I mean what I told you that day at Black Fells, when we were
      riding. I told you you had a chance to win out. Now the chance has come&mdash;same's
      I told you. Start in, and by the time you're ready to say 'When?' she'll
      be there with the bottle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you are perfectly sane yet,&rdquo; said Plank slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it go at that, then,&rdquo; sniggered Mortimer, struggling to his feet.
      &ldquo;Bring Leila back; I'm all in; I'm going home. You'll be around in the
      morning, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Plank. &ldquo;Have you got a cab?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer had one. The glass and iron doors clanged behind him, and Plank,
      waiting a moment, sighed, raised his head, and, encountering the curious
      gaze of a servant, trudged off up-stairs again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game had ended at both tables. Quarrier and Agatha stood by the window
      together, conversing in low voices. Belwether, at a desk, sat muttering
      and fussing with a cheque-book. The others were in Sylvia's apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later Kemp Ferrall arrived, in the best of spirits, very
      much inclined to consider the night as still young; but his enthusiasm met
      with no response, and presently he departed with his wife and Marion in
      their big Mercedes, wheeling into the avenue at a reckless pace, and
      streaming away through the night like a meteor run mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leila, in her wraps, emerged in a few moments, looking at Plank out of
      serious eyes; and they made their brief adieux and went away in Plank's
      brougham.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Agatha's maid arrived, Quarrier also started to take his leave; but
      Sylvia, seated at a card-table, idly arranging the cards in geometrical
      designs and fanciful arabesques, looked up at him, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to say something to you, Howard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Agatha passed them, going into Sylvia's room for her wraps; and Quarrier
      turned to Sylvia:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, with the slightest hint of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you stay a minute?&rdquo; asked Sylvia, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agatha is going in the motor with me. Is it anything important?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She considered him without replying. She had never before detected that
      manner, that hardness in a voice always so even in quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought a moment, putting aside for the time his manner, which she
      could not comprehend; then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to ask you a question&mdash;a rather ignorant one, perhaps. It's
      about your Amalgamated Electric Company. May I ask it, Howard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a second's stare, &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only this: If the other people&mdash;the Inter-County, I mean&mdash;are
      slowly ruining Amalgamated, why don't you stop it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier's eyes narrowed. &ldquo;Oh! And who have you been discussing the matter
      with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Plank,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;I asked him. He shook his head, and said
      I'd better ask you. And I do ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he stood mute; then his lips began to shrink back over his
      beautiful teeth in one of his rare laughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be very glad to explain it some day,&rdquo; he said; but there was no
      mirth in his voice or eyes, only the snickering lip wrinkling the pallor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not answer now?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not now. But I desire you to understand it some day&mdash;some day
      before November. And one or two other matters that it is necessary for you
      to understand. I want to explain them, Sylvia, in such a manner that you
      will never be likely to forget them. And I mean to; for they are never out
      of my mind, and I wish them to be as ineffaceably impressed on yours....
      Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her limp hand almost briskly, released it, and stepped down the
      stairs as Agatha entered, cloaked, to say good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      They kissed at parting&mdash;&ldquo;life embracing death&rdquo;&mdash;as Mortimer had
      sneered on a similar occasion; then Sylvia, alone, stood in her bedroom,
      hands linked behind her, her lovely head bent, groping with the very
      ghosts of thought which eluded her, fleeing, vanishing, reappearing, to
      peep out at her only to fade into nothing ere she could follow where they
      flitted through the dark labyrinths of memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The major, craning his neck in the bay-window, saw Agatha and Quarrier
      enter the big, yellow motor, and disappear behind the limousine. And it
      worried him horribly, because he knew perfectly well that Quarrier had
      lied to him about a jewelled collar precisely like the collar worn by
      Agatha Caithness; and what to do or what to say to anybody on the subject
      was, for the first time in his life, utterly beyond his garrulous ability.
      So, for the first time also in his chattering career, he held his tongue,
      reassured at moments, at other moments panic-stricken lest this marriage
      he had engineered should go amiss, and his ambitions be nipped at the very
      instant of triumphant maturity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This sort of thing&mdash;in your own caste&mdash;among your own kind,&rdquo;
       his panicky thoughts ran on, &ldquo;is b-bad form&mdash;rotten bad taste on both
      sides. If they were married&mdash;one of them, anyway! But this isn't
      right; no, by gad! it's bad taste, and no gentleman could countenance it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was plain that he could, however, his only fear being that somebody
      might whisper something to turn Sylvia's innocence into a terrible wisdom
      which would ruin everything, and knock the underpinning from the new tower
      which his inflated fancy beheld slowly growing heavenward, surmounting the
      house of Belwether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another matter: he had violated his word, and had been caught at it by his
      prospective nephew-in-law&mdash;broken his pledged word not to sell his
      Amalgamated Electric holdings, and had done it. Yet, how could Plank
      dominate, unless another also had done what he had done? And it made him a
      little more comfortable to know he was sharing the fault with somebody&mdash;probably
      with Siward, whom he now had the luxury of despising for the very thing he
      himself had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drunkard!&rdquo; he muttered to himself; &ldquo;he's in the gutter at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he repeated it unctuously, almost reconciled to his own shortcoming,
      because it was the first time, as far as he knew, that a Belwether might
      legitimately enjoy the pleasures of holding the word of a Siward in
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia had dismissed her maid, the old feeling of distaste for the touch
      of another had returned since the last mad, crushed embrace in Siward's
      arms had become a memory. More and more she was returning to old
      instincts, old habits of thought, reverting to type once more, virgin of
      lip and thought and desire, save when the old memory stopped her heart
      suddenly, then sent it racing, touching her face with quick, crimson
      imprint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, blue eyes dreaming under the bright masses of her loosened hair, she
      sat watching the last glimmer amid the ashes whitening on the hearth,
      thinking of Siward and of what had been between them, and of what could
      never be&mdash;never, never be.
    </p>
    <p>
      One red spark among the ashes&mdash;her ambition, deathless amid the ashes
      of life! When that, too, went out, life must be extinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he had roused in her had died when he went away. It could never awake
      again, unless he returned to awaken it. And he never would; he would never
      come again.
    </p>
    <p>
      One brief interlude of love, of passion, in her life could neither tint
      nor taint the cool, normal sequence of her days. All that life held for a
      woman of her caste&mdash;all save that&mdash;was hers when she stretched
      out her hand for it&mdash;hers by right of succession, of descent; hers by
      warrant unquestioned, by the unuttered text of the ukase to be launched,
      if necessary, by that very, very old lady, drowsing, enthroned, as the
      endless pageant wound like a jewelled river at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Siward could never come again, sauntering toward her through the
      sunlight, smiling his absent smile. She caught her breath painfully,
      straightening up; a single ash fell in the fire; the last spark went out.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI THE CALL OF THE RAIN
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The park was very misty and damp and still that morning.
    </h3>
    <p>
      There was a scent of sap and new buds in the February haze, a glimmer of
      green on southern slopes, a distant bird note, tentative, then confident,
      rippling from the gray tangle of naked thickets. Here and there in hollows
      the tips of amber-tinted shoots pricked the soil's dark surface; here and
      there in the sparse woodlands a withered leaf still clinging to oak or
      beech was forced to let go by the swelling bud at its base and fell
      rustling stiffly in the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far away on the wooded bridle-path the dulled double gallop of horses
      sounded, now muffled in a hollow, now louder, jarring the rising ground,
      nearer, heavier, then suddenly checked to a trample, as Sylvia drew bridle
      by the reservoir, and, straightening in her saddle, raised her flushed
      face to the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rain?&rdquo; she asked, as Quarrier, controlling his beautiful, restive horse,
      ranged up beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; he said, scarcely glancing at the sky, where, above the great
      rectangular lagoons, hundreds of sea-gulls, high in the air, hung
      flapping, stemming some rushing upper gale unfelt below.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked her mount, head lifted, watching the gulls; he followed,
      uninterested, imperturbable in his finished horsemanship. With horses he
      always appeared to advantage, whether on the box of break or coach, or
      silently controlling a spike or tandem, or sitting his saddle in his
      long-limbed, faultless fashion, maintaining without effort the very
      essence of form. Here he was at his best, perfectly informal, informally
      perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had ridden every day since the weather permitted&mdash;even before it
      permitted&mdash;thrashing and slashing through the rotting ice and snow,
      galloping over the frozen, gravelly loam, amid leafless trees and a
      winter-smitten perspective&mdash;drearier for the distant, eastern glimpse
      of the avenue's marble and limestone faÃ§ades and the vast cliffs of
      masonry and brick looming above the west and south.
    </p>
    <p>
      On these daily rides together it was her custom to discuss practical
      matters concerning their future; and it was his custom to listen until
      pressed for a suggestion, an assent, or a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sparing words&mdash;cautious, chary of self-commitment, and seldom
      offering to assume the initiative&mdash;this was the surface character
      which she had come to recognise and acquiesce in; this was Quarrier as he
      had been developed from her hazy, preconceived ideas of the man before she
      had finally accepted him at Shotover the autumn before. She also knew him
      as a methodical man, exacting from others the orderly precision which
      characterised his own dealings; a man of education and little learning, of
      attainments and little cultivation, conversant with usages, formal,
      intensely sensitive to ridicule, incapable of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Quarrier as she knew him or had known him. Recently she had,
      little by little, become aware of an indefinable change in the man. For
      one thing, he had grown more reticent. At times, too, his reserve seemed
      to have something almost surly about it; under his cold composure a hint
      of something concealed, watchful, and very quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confidences she had never looked for in him nor desired. It appalled her
      at moments to realise how little they had in common, and that only on the
      surface&mdash;a communion of superficial interest incident to the
      fulfilment of social duties and the pursuit of pleasure. Beyond that she
      knew nothing of him, required nothing of him. What was there to know? what
      to require?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the main line of her route through life had been surveyed and
      carefully laid out, what was there more for her in life than to set out
      upon her progress? It was her own road. Presumptive leader already,
      logical leader from the day she married&mdash;leader, in fact, when the
      ukase, her future legacy, so decreed; it was a royal road laid out for her
      through the gardens and pleasant places; a road for her alone, and over it
      she had chosen to pass. What more was there to desire?
    </p>
    <p>
      From the going of Siward, all that he had aroused in her of love, of
      intelligence, of wholesome desire and sane curiosity&mdash;the
      intellectual restlessness, the capacity for passion, the renaissance of
      the simpler innocence&mdash;had subsided into the laissez faire of dull
      quiescence. If in her he had sown, imprudently, subtle, impulsive,
      unworldly ideas, flowering into sudden brilliancy in the quick magic of
      his companionship, now those flowers were dead under the inexorable winter
      of her ambition, where all such things lay; her lonely childhood, with its
      dimmed visions of mother-love ineffable; the strange splendour of the
      dreams haunting her adolescence&mdash;pageants of bravery and the glitter
      of the cross, altars of self-denial and pure intent, service and sacrifice
      and the scorn of wrong; and sometimes, seen dimly with enraptured eyes
      through dissolving mists&mdash;the man! glimmering for an instant, then
      fading, resolved into the starry void which fashioned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riding there, head bent, her pulses timing the slow pacing of her horse,
      she presently became aware, without looking up, that Quarrier was watching
      her. Dreams vanished. A perfectly unreasonable sense of being spied upon,
      of something stealthy about it all, flashed to her mind and was gone,
      leaving her grave and perplexed. What a strange suspicion! What an
      infernal inference! What grotesque train of thought could have culminated
      in such a sinister idea!
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved slightly in her saddle to look at him, and for an instant
      fancied that there was something furtive in his eyes; only for an instant,
      for he quietly picked up the thread of conversation where she had dropped
      it, saying that it had been raining for the last ten minutes, and that
      they might as well turn their horses toward shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mind the rain,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;there is a spring-like odour in it.
      Don't you notice it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not particularly,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was miles away a moment ago,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;years away, I mean&mdash;a
      little girl again, with two stiff yellow braids, trying to pretend that a
      big arm-chair was my mother's lap and that I could hear her whispering to
      me. And there I sat, on a day like this, listening, pretending, cuddled up
      tight, and looking out at the first rain of the year falling in the
      backyard. There was an odour like this about it all. Memory, they say, is
      largely a matter of nose!&rdquo; She laughed, fearing that he might have thought
      her sentimental, already regretting the familiarity of thrusting such
      trivial and personal incidents upon his notice. He was probably too
      indifferent to comment on it, merely nodding as she ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, without reason, through and through her shot a shiver of loneliness&mdash;utter
      loneliness and isolation. Without reason, because from him she expected
      nothing, required nothing, except what he offered&mdash;the emotionless
      reticence of indifference, the composure of perfect formality. What did
      she want, then&mdash;companions? She had them. Friends? She could scarcely
      escape from them. Intimates? She had only to choose one or a hundred
      attuned responsive to her every mood, every caprice. Lonely? With the men
      of New York crowding, shouldering, crushing their way to her feet? Lonely?
      With the women of New York struggling already for precedence in her
      favour?&mdash;omen significant of the days to come, of those future years
      diamond-linked in one unbroken, triumphant glitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lonely!
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain was falling out of the hanging mist, something more than a
      drizzle now. Quarrier spoke of it again, but she shook her head, walking
      her horse slowly onward. The train of thought she followed was slower
      still, winding on and on, leading her into half light and shadow, and in
      and out through hidden trails she should have known by this time&mdash;always
      on, skirting the objective, circling it through sudden turns. And now she
      was becoming conscious of the familiar way; now she recognised the quiet,
      still by-ways of the maze she seemed doomed to wander in forever. But, for
      that matter, all paths of thought were alike to her, for, sooner or later,
      all ultimately led to him; and this she was already aware of as a
      disturbing phenomenon to consider and account for and to provide against&mdash;when
      she had leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About that Amalgamated Electric Company,&rdquo; she began without prelude;
      &ldquo;would you mind answering a question or two, Howard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not understand it,&rdquo; he said, unpleasantly disturbed by her
      abruptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please. It is quite true I can make nothing of what the newspapers
      are saying about it, except that Mr. Plank seems to be doing a number of
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Injunctions, and other matters,&rdquo; observed Quarrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is anybody going to lose any money in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, for example?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;you, for example,&rdquo; she said, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't expect to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is going to turn out all right? And Mr. Plank and Kemp Ferrall
      and the major and&mdash;the other people interested, are not going to be
      almost ruined by the Inter-County people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think a man like Plank is likely to be ruined, as you say, by
      Amalgamated Electric?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But Kemp and the major&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the major is out of danger,&rdquo; replied Quarrier, looking at her
      with the new, sullen narrowing of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of that. Is Kemp&mdash;and the others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ferrall could stand it if matters go wrong. What others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;the other owners and stockholders&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What others? Who do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Siward, for example,&rdquo; she said in an even voice, leaning over to pat
      her horse's neck with her gloved hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Siward must take the chances we all take,&rdquo; observed Quarrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Howard, it would really mean ruin for him if matters went badly.
      Wouldn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not familiar with the details of Mr. Siward's investments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor am I,&rdquo; she said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lack of emotion in the man beside her she always expected, and therefore
      this new, sullen note in his voice perplexed her. Too, at times, in his
      increasing reticence there seemed to be almost a hint of cold effrontery.
      She felt it now&mdash;an indefinite suggestion of displeasure and the
      power to retaliate; something evasive, watchful, patiently hostile; and,
      try as she might, she could not rid herself of the discomfort of it, and
      the perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke about other things; he responded in his impassive manner.
      Presently she turned her horse and Quarrier wheeled his, facing a warm,
      fine rain, slanting thickly from the south.
    </p>
    <p>
      His silky, Vandyke beard was all wet with the moisture. She noticed it,
      and unbidden arose the vision of the gun-room at Shotover: Quarrier's soft
      beard wet with rain; the phantoms of people passing and repassing;
      Siward's straight figure swinging past, silhouetted against the glare of
      light from the billiard-room. And here she made an effort to efface the
      vision, shutting her eyes as she rode there in the rain. But clearly
      against the closed lids she saw the phantoms passing&mdash;spectres of
      dead hours, the wraith of an old happiness masked with youth and wearing
      Siward's features!
    </p>
    <p>
      She must stop it! What was all this crowding in upon her as she rode
      forward through the driving rain&mdash;all this resurgence of ghosts long
      laid, long exorcised? Had the odour of the rain stolen her senses,
      awakening memory of childish solitude? Was it that which was drugging her
      with remembrance of Siward and the rattle of rain in the bay-window above
      the glass-roofed swimming-pool?
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her eyes wide, staring straight ahead into the thickening rain;
      but her thoughts were loosened now, tuned to the increasing rhythm of her
      heart: and she saw him seated there, his head buried in his hands as she
      stole through the dim corridors to her first tryst; saw him look up; saw
      herself beside him among the cushions; tasted again the rose-petals that
      her lips had stripped from the blossoms; saw once more the dawn of
      something in his steady eyes; felt his arm about her, his breath&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her horse, suddenly spurred, bounded forward through the rain, and she
      rode breathless, with lips half parted, as if afraid, turning her head to
      look behind&mdash;as though she could outride the phantom clinging to her
      stirrup, masked like youth, wearing the shadowy eyes of Love!
    </p>
    <p>
      In her drenched habit, standing before her dressing-room fire, she heard
      her maid soliciting entrance, and paid no heed, the door being locked&mdash;as
      though a spectre could be bolted out of rooms and houses! Pacing the
      floor, restless, annoyed, and dismayed by turns, she flung her wet skirt
      and coat from her, piece by piece, and stood for awhile, like some slender
      youth in riding breeches and shirt, facing the fire, her fingers resting
      on her hips.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dull light of a rainy noon-day the fire reddened the ceiling,
      throwing her giant shadow across the wall, where it towered, swaying, like
      a ghost above her. She caught sight of it over her shoulder, and watched
      it absently; then gazed into the coals again, her chin dropping on her
      bared chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      At her maid's repeated knocking she turned, her boots and the single spur
      sparkling in the firelight, and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, fresh from her bath, luxurious in loose and filmy lace, her
      small, white feet shod with silk, she lunched alone, cradled among the
      cushions of her couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice she strolled through the rooms leisurely, summoned by her maid to
      the telephone; the first time to chat with Grace Ferrall, who, it
      appeared, was a victim of dissipation, being still abed, and out of humour
      with the rainy world; the second time to answer in the negative Marion's
      suggestion that she motor to Lakewood with her for the week's end before
      they closed their house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sauntering back again, she sipped her milk and vichy, tasted the
      strawberries, tasted a big black grape, discarded both, and lay back among
      the cushions, her naked arms clasped behind her head, and dropping one
      knee over the other, stared at the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Restlessness and caprice ruled her. She seldom smoked, but seeing on the
      table a stray cigarette of the sort she kept for any intimates who might
      desire them, she stretched out her arm, scratched a match, and lighted it
      with a dainty grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lying there, she tried to make rings; but the smoke only got into her
      delicate uptilted nose and stung her tongue, and she very soon had enough
      of her cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching the slow fire consume it between her fingers she lay supine,
      following the spirals of smoke with inattentive eyes. By-and-by the
      lengthening ash fell, powdering her, and she threw the cigarette into the
      grate, flicked the ashes from her bare, round arm, and, clasping her hands
      under her neck, turned over and closed her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleep?&mdash;with every pulse awake and throbbing, every heart-beat
      sending the young blood rushing out through a body the incarnation of
      youth and life itself! There was a faint flush in the hollow of each
      upturned palm, where the fingers like relaxed petals curled inward; a
      deepening tint in the parted lips; and under the lids, through the dusk of
      the lashes, a glimmer of blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lying there, veiled gaze conscious of the rose-light which glowed and
      waned on the ceiling, she awaited the flowing tide on which so often she
      had embarked and drifted out into that golden gloom serene, where, spirit
      becalmed, Time and Grief faded, and Desire died out upon the unshadowed
      sea of dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is long waiting for the tide when the wakeful heart beats loudly, when
      the pulses quicken at a memory, and the thousand idle little cellules of
      the brain, long sealed, long unused, and consigned to the archives of What
      Is Ended, open one by one, releasing each its own forgotten ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how can the heart rest, the pulse sleep, startled to a flutter, as one
      by one the tiny cells unclose unbidden, and the dead remembrance, from its
      cerements freed, brightens to life?
    </p>
    <p>
      Words he had used, the idle lifting of his head, the forgotten inflection
      of his voice, the sunlight on his hair and the sea-wind stirring it; his
      figure as it turned to move away, the half-caught echo of his laugh,
      faint, faint!&mdash;so that her own ears, throbbing, strained to listen;
      the countless unimportant moments she had thought unmarked, yet carefully
      stored up, without her knowledge, in the magic cellules of her brain&mdash;all,
      all were coming back to life, more and more distinct, startlingly clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she lay like one afraid to move, lest her stirring waken a vague
      something that still slept, something she dared not arouse, dared not meet
      face to face, even in dreams. An interval&mdash;perhaps an hour, perhaps a
      second&mdash;passed, leaving her stranded so close to the shoals of
      slumber that sleep passed only near enough to awaken her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was very still and dim, but the clamour in her brain unnerved
      her, and she sat up among the cushions, looking vacantly about her with
      the blue, confused eyes, the direct, unseeing gaze of a child roused by a
      half-heard call.
    </p>
    <p>
      The call&mdash;low, imperative, sustained&mdash;continued softly
      persistent against her windows&mdash;the summons of the young year's rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to the window and stood among the filmy curtains, looking out
      into the mist; a springlike aroma penetrated the room. She opened the
      window a little way, and the sweet, virile odour enveloped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand longings rose within her; unnumbered wistful questions stirred
      her, sighing, unanswered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aware that her lips were moving unconsciously, she listened to the words
      forming automatic repetitions of phrases long forgotten:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And those that look out of the windows be darkened, And the door shall be
      shut in the streets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What was it she was repeating?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fear shall be in the
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What echo of the past was this?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And desire shall fail: because&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Intent, absorbed in retracing the forgotten sequence to its source, she
      stood, breathing the thickening incense of the rain; and every breath was
      drawing her backward, nearer, nearer to the source of memory. Ah, the
      cliff chapel in the rain!&mdash;the words of a text mumbled deafly&mdash;the
      yearly service for those who died at sea! And she, seated there in the
      chapel dusk thinking of him who sat beside her, and how he feared a
      heavier, stealthier, more secret tide crawling, purring about his feet!
    </p>
    <p>
      Enfin! Always, always at the end of everything, He! Always, reckoning step
      by step, backward through time, He! the source, the inception, the meaning
      of all!
    </p>
    <p>
      Unmoored at last, her spirit swaying, enveloped in memories of him, she
      gave herself to the flood&mdash;overwhelmed, as tide on tide rose, rushing
      over her&mdash;body, mind, and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed her eyes, leaning there heavily amid the cloudy curtains; she
      moved back into the room and stood staring at space through wet lashes.
      The hard, dry pulse in her throat hurt her till her under lip, freed from
      the tyranny of her small teeth, slipped free, quivering rebellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been walking her room to and fro, to and fro, for a long time
      before she realised that she had moved at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, impulse held the helm; a blind, unreasoning desire for relief
      hurried into action on the wings of impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a telephone at her elbow. No need to hunt through lists to find
      a number she had known so long by heart&mdash;the three figures which had
      reiterated themselves so often, monotonously insistent, slyly persuasive;
      repeating themselves even in her dreams, so that she awoke at times
      shivering with the vision in which she had listened to temptation, and had
      called to him across the wilderness of streets and men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you ask him to come to the telephone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please say to him that it is a&mdash;a friend.... Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the throbbing quiet of her room she heard the fingers of the prying
      rain busy at her windows; the ticking of the small French clock, very
      dull, very far away&mdash;or was it her heart? And, faintly ringing in the
      receiver pressed against her ear, millions of tiny stirrings, sounds like
      instruments of an elfin orchestra tuning, echoes as of steps passing
      through the halls of fairy-land, a faint confusion of human-like tones;
      then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice left her for an instant; her dry lips made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he repeated in his steady, pleasant voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was absolute silence&mdash;so long that it frightened her. But
      before she could speak again his voice was sounding in her ears, patient,
      unconvinced:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't recognise your voice. Who am I speaking to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no response, and she spoke again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wanted to say good morning. It is afternoon now; is it too late to
      say good morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I'm badly rattled. Is it you, Sylvia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it is. I am in my own room. I&mdash;I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what I did think. Is it necessary for me to telephone you a
      minute account of the mental processes which ended by my calling you up&mdash;out
      of the vasty deep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old ring in her voice hinting of the laughing undertone, the same
      trailing sweetness of inflection&mdash;could he doubt his senses any
      longer?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you, now,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you might. I should very much like to know how you are&mdash;if
      you don't mind saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I seem to be all right. Are you all right, Sylvia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shamefully and outrageously well. What a season, too! Everybody else is
      in rags&mdash;make-up rags! Isn't that a disagreeable remark? But I'll
      come to the paint-brush too, of course.... We all do. Doesn't anybody ever
      see you any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard him laugh to himself unpleasantly; then: &ldquo;Does anybody want to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody, of course! You know it. You always were spoiled to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you becoming cynical?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Why should I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are! Stop it! Mercy on us! If that is what is going on in a certain
      house on lower Fifth Avenue, facing the corner of certain streets, it's
      time somebody dropped in to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the rescue! I've a mind to do it myself. They say you are not well,
      either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who says that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the usual little ornithological cockatrice&mdash;or, rather,
      cantatrice. Don't ask me, because I won't tell you. I always tell you too
      much, anyway. Don't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do. Everybody spoils you and so do I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I am rather in that way, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;spoiled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in a lower voice: &ldquo;Please don't say such things&mdash;will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially to you. No, I won't, Sylvia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, after a hesitation, she continued sweetly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what you were doing, all alone in that old house of yours, when
      I called you up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Let me see. Oh, I was superintending some packing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going off somewhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, Sylvia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen, how absurd! You must know where you are going! If you mean that
      you don't care to tell me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean&mdash;that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I decline to be snubbed. I'm shameless, and I wish to be informed. Please
      tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd rather not tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.... Good-bye.... But don't ring off just yet, Stephen.... Do
      you think that, sometime, you would care to see&mdash;any people&mdash;I
      mean when you begin to go out again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, for example?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, anybody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don't think I should care to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would care to. It is not well to let go every tie, drop
      everybody so completely. No man can do that to advantage. It would be so
      much better for you to go about a bit&mdash;see and be seen, you know;
      just to meet a few people informally; go to see some pretty girl you know
      well enough to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what? Make love to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would he very good for you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not for the pretty girl. Besides, I'm rather too busy to go about,
      even if I were inclined to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really busy, Stephen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;waiting. That is the very hardest sort of occupation. And I'm
      obliged to be on hand every minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said that you were going out of town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I? Well, I did not say it, exactly, but I am going to leave town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For very long?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. I can't tell yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen, before you go&mdash;if you are going for a very, very long while&mdash;perhaps
      you will&mdash;you might care to say good-bye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said innocently; &ldquo;but if you care&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you care to have me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence; and when his voice sounded again it had altered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think you would care to see me, Sylvia. I&mdash;they say I am&mdash;I
      have&mdash;changed&mdash;since my&mdash;since a slight illness. I am not
      over it yet, not cured&mdash;not very well yet; and a little tired, you
      see&mdash;a little shaken. I am leaving New York to&mdash;to try once more
      to be cured. I expect to be well&mdash;one way or another&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen, where are you going? Answer me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't answer you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your illness serious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;it is&mdash;it requires some&mdash;some care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her fingers tightening around the receiver whitened to the delicate nails
      under the pressure. Mute, struggling with the mounting impulse, voice and
      lip unsteady, she still spoke with restraint:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you require care? And what care have you? Who is there with you?
      Answer me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;everybody; the servants. I have care enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the servants! Have you a physician to advise you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;the best in the world. Sylvia, dea&mdash;, Sylvia, I
      didn't mean to give you an impression&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen, I will have you truthful with me! I know perfectly well you are
      ill. I&mdash;if I could only&mdash;if there was something, some way&mdash;Listen:
      I am&mdash;I am going to do something about it, and I don't care very much
      what I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sweet nonsense!&rdquo; he laughed, but his voice was no steadier than
      hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you drive with me?&rdquo; she asked impulsively, &ldquo;some afternoon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvia, dear, you don't really want me to do it. Wait, listen: I&mdash;I've
      got to tell you that&mdash;that I'm not fit for it. I've got to be honest
      with you; I am not fit, not in physical condition to go out just yet. I've
      really been ill&mdash;for weeks. Plank has been very nice to me. I want to
      get well; I mean to try very hard. But the man you knew&mdash;is&mdash;changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Changed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in that way!&rdquo; he said in a slow voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how, then?&rdquo; she stammered, all a-thrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nerve gone&mdash;almost. Going to get it back again, of course. Feel a
      million times better already for talking with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do&mdash;does it really help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the only panacea for me,&rdquo; he said too quickly to consider his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only one?&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;Do you mean to say that your trouble&mdash;illness&mdash;has
      anything to do with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! I only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it, Stephen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, if I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvia, I'm not that sort! You mustn't talk to me that way. There's
      nothing to be sorry for about me. Any man may lose his nerve, and, if he
      is a man, go after it and get it back again. Every man has a fighting
      chance. You said it yourself once&mdash;that a man mustn't ask for a
      fighting chance; he must take it. And I'm going to take it and win out one
      way or another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by 'another,' Stephen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;Nothing. It's a phrase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? Answer me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a phrase,&rdquo; he said again; &ldquo;no meaning, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen, Mr. Plank says that you are lame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say that for?&rdquo; demanded Siward wrathfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked him. Kemp saw you on crutches at your window. So I asked Mr.
      Plank, and he said you had discarded your crutches too soon and had fallen
      and lamed yourself again. Are you able to walk yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Outdoors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;no, not just yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, you are practically bedridden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! I can get about the room very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn't go down-stairs&mdash;for an hour's drive, could you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't manage that for awhile,&rdquo; he said hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the vanity of you, Stephen Siward! the vanity! Ashamed to let me see
      you when you are not your complete and magnificently attractive self!
      Silly, I shall see you! I shall drive down on the first sunny morning and
      sit outside in my victoria until you can't stand the temptation another
      instant. I'm going to do it. You cannot stop me; nobody can stop me. I
      desire to do it, and that is sufficient, I think, for everybody concerned.
      If the sun is out to-morrow, I shall be out too!... I am so tired of not
      seeing you! Let central listen! I don't care. I don't care what I am
      saying. I've endured it so long&mdash;I&mdash;There's no use! I am too
      tired of it, and I want to see you.... Can't we see each other without&mdash;without&mdash;thinking
      about things that are settled once and for all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'd better learn to! Because, if you think I'm going through life
      without seeing you frequently you are simple! I've stood it too long at a
      time. I won't go through this sort of thing again! You'd better be
      amiable; you'd better be civil to me, or&mdash;or&mdash;nobody on earth
      can tell what will happen! The idea of you telling me you had lost your
      nerve! You've got to get it back&mdash;and help me find mine! Yes, it's
      gone, gone, gone! I lost it in the rain, somewhere, to-day.... Does the
      scent of the rain come in at your window?... Do you remember&mdash;There!
      I can't say it.... Good-bye. Good-bye. You must get well and I must, too.
      Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fruit of her imprudence was happiness&mdash;an excited happiness,
      which lasted for a day. The rain lasted, too, for another day, then turned
      to snow, choking the city with such a fall as had not been seen since the
      great blizzard&mdash;blocking avenues, barricading cross-streets, burying
      squares and circles and parks, and still falling, drifting, whirling like
      wind-whipped smoke from cornice and roof-top. The electric cars halted;
      even the great snow-ploughs roared impotent amid the snowy wastes; waggons
      floundered into cross-streets and stuck until dug out; and everywhere, in
      the thickening obscurity, battalions of emergency men with pick and shovel
      struggled with the drifts in Fifth Avenue and Broadway. Then the storm
      ended at daybreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day long squadrons of white gulls wheeled and sailed in the sky above
      the snowy expanse of park where the great, rectangular sheets of water
      glimmered black in their white setting. As she sat at her desk she could
      see them drifting into and out of the gray squares of sky framed by her
      window-panes. Two days ago she had seen them stemming the sky blasts,
      heralding the coming of unfelt tempests, flapping steadily through the
      fragrant rain. Now, the false phantom which had mimicked spring turned on
      the world the glassy glare of winter, stupefying hope, stunning desire,
      clogging the life essence in all young, living things. The first vague
      summons, the restlessness of awakening aspiration, the first delicate,
      indrawn breath, were stilled to deathly immobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia, at her escritoire, chin cradled in her hollowed hand, sat
      listlessly inspecting her mail&mdash;the usual pile of bills and
      advertisements, social demands and interested appeals, with here and there
      a frivolous note from some intimate to punctuate the endless
      importunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her housekeeper had come and gone; the Belwether establishment could jog
      through another day. Various specialists, who cared for the health and
      beauty of her body, had entered and made their unctuous exits. The major
      had gone to Tuxedo for the week's end; her maid had bronchitis; two horses
      required the veterinary, and the kitchen range a new water-back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cards had come for the Caithness function; cards for young Austin
      Wadsworth's wedding to a Charleston girl of rumoured beauty; Caragnini was
      to sing for Mrs. Vendenning; a live llama, two-legged, had consented to
      undermine Christianity for Mrs. Pyne-Johnson and her guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would Sylvia be ready for the inspection of imported head-gears to
      harmonise with the gowns being built by Constantine?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would she receive the courteous agent of 'The Reigning Beauties of
      Manhattan,' to arrange for her portrait and biographical sketch?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would she realise that Jefferson B. Doty could turn earth into heaven for
      any young chatelaine by affixing to the laundry his anti-microbe drying
      machine emitting sixty sterilised hot-air blasts in thirty seconds, at a
      cost of one-tenth of one mill per blast?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she turned her head, looking wearily across the room at the brightly
      burning fire beside which Mrs. Ferrall sat, nibbling mint-paste, very
      serious over one of those books that &ldquo;everybody was reading.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far have you read?&rdquo; inquired Sylvia without interest, turning over a
      new letter to cut with her paper-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace ruffled the uncut pages of her book without looking up, then yawned
      shamelessly: &ldquo;She's decided to try living with him for awhile, and if they
      find life agreeable she'll marry him.... Pleasant situation, isn't it?
      Nice book, very; and they say that somebody is making a play of it. I&rdquo;&mdash;She
      yawned again, showing her small, brilliant teeth&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder what sort
      of people write these immoral romances!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably immoral people,&rdquo; said Sylvia indifferently. &ldquo;Drop it on the
      coals, Grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Ferrall reopened the book where she had laid her finger to mark
      the place. &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That rotten books and plays come from morally rotten people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think about it at all,&rdquo; observed Sylvia, opening another letter
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're probably not very literary,&rdquo; said Grace mischievously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in that way, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ferrall took another bonbon: &ldquo;Did you see 'Mrs. Lane's Experiment'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Sylvia, looking up, the pink creeping into her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought it very strong, I suppose?&rdquo; asked Grace innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it incredible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, dear, it was sheer realism! Why blink at truth? And when an author
      has the courage to tell facts why not have the courage to applaud?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is truth, it doesn't concern me,&rdquo; said Sylvia. &ldquo;Grace, why will
      you pose, even if you are married? for you have a clean mind, and you know
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Ferrall, closing her book again, but keeping the
      place with her finger; &ldquo;and that's why I'm so curious about all these
      depraved people. I can't understand why writers have not found out that we
      women are instinctively innocent, even after we are obliged to make our
      morality a profession and our innocence an art. They all hang their
      romances to motives that no woman recognises as feminine; they ascribe to
      us instincts which we do not possess, passions of which we are ignorant&mdash;a
      ridiculous moral turpitude in the overmastering presence of love. Pooh! If
      they only knew what a small part love plays with us, after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia said slowly: &ldquo;It sometimes plays a small part, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always,&rdquo; insisted Grace with emphasis. &ldquo;No carefully watched girl knows
      what it is, whatever her suspicions may be. When she marries, if she
      doesn't marry from family pressure or from her own motives of common-sense
      ambition, she marries because she likes the man, not because she loves
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, even if she wanted to love him,&rdquo; continued Grace, &ldquo;she would not
      know how. It's the ingrained innocence which men encounter that they don't
      allow for or understand in us. Even after we are married, and whether or
      not we learn to love our husbands, it remains part of us as an educated
      instinct; and it takes all the scientific, selfish ruthlessness of a man
      to break it down. That's why I say so few among us ever comprehend the
      motives attributed to us in romance or in that parody of it called
      realism. Love is rarer with us than men could ever believe&mdash;and I'm
      glad of it,&rdquo; she said maliciously, with a final snap of her pretty teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was on that theory you advised me, I think,&rdquo; said Sylvia, looking into
      the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Advised you, child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;about accepting Howard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Is it not a sound theory? Doesn't it stand inspection? Doesn't
      it wear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;wears,&rdquo; said Sylvia indifferently. Grace looked up from her open
      book. &ldquo;Is anything amiss?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you know, child. What is wrong? Has Howard made himself
      insufferable? He's a master at it. Has he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don't remember that he has.... I'm tired, physically. I'm tired of
      the winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to Florida for Lent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horror! It's as stupid as a hothouse. It isn't that, either, dear&mdash;only,
      when it was raining so deliciously the other day I was silly enough to
      think I scented the spring in the park. I was glad of a change you know&mdash;any
      excuse to stop this eternal carnival I live in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Ferrall, withdrawing her finger from
      the pages and plumping the closed book down on her knee. &ldquo;You'd better
      tell me, Sylvia; you might just as well tell me now as later when my
      persistence has vexed us both. Now, what has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been&mdash;imprudent,&rdquo; said Sylvia, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Ferrall looked at her keenly&mdash;&ldquo;that he has
      been here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I telephoned him; and I asked him to drive with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sylvia, what nonsense! Why on earth do you stir yourself up by that
      sort of silliness at this late date? What use is it? Can't you let him
      alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;No, I can't, it seems. Grace, I was&mdash;I felt so&mdash;so
      strangely about it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what, little idiot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About leaving him&mdash;alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you Stephen Siward's keeper?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Ferrall, exasperated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt as though I were, for awhile. He is ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With an illness that, thank God, you are not going to nurse through life.
      Don't look at me that way, dear. I'm obliged to speak harshly; I'm obliged
      to harden my heart to such a monstrous idea. You know I love you; you know
      I care deeply for that poor boy&mdash;but do you think I could be loyal to
      either of you and not say what I do say? He is doomed, as sure as you sit
      there! He has fallen, and no one can help him. Link after link he has
      broken with his own world; his master-vice holds him faster, closer, more
      absolutely, than hell ever held a lost soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace, I cannot endure&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must! Are you trying to drug your silly self with romance so you
      won't recognise truth when you see it? Are you drifting back into old
      impulses, unreasoning whims of caprice? Have you forgotten what I know of
      you, and what you know of yourself? Is the taint of your transmitted
      inheritance beginning to show in you&mdash;the one woman of your race who
      is fashioned to withstand it and stamp it out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am mistress of my emotions,&rdquo; said Sylvia, flushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then suppress them,&rdquo; retorted Grace Ferrall hotly, &ldquo;before they begin to
      bully you. There was no earthly reason for you to talk to Stephen. No
      disinterested impulse moved you. It was a sheer perverse, sentimental
      restlessness&mdash;the delicate, meddlesome deviltry of your race. And if
      that poison is in you, it's well for you to know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is in me,&rdquo; said Sylvia, staring at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know what to do for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do,&rdquo; said Grace decisively; &ldquo;and the sooner you marry Howard and
      intrench yourself behind your pride, the better off you'll be. That's
      where, fortunately enough, you differ from your ancestors; you are unable
      to understand marital treachery. Otherwise you'd make it lively for us
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Sylvia deliberately, &ldquo;that I could not be treacherous
      to anybody. But I am wondering; I am asking myself just what constitutes
      treachery to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sentimentalising over Stephen might fill the bill,&rdquo; observed Grace
      tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it doesn't seem to,&rdquo; mused Sylvia, her blue gaze on the coals. &ldquo;That
      is what I do not understand. I have no conscience concerning what I feel
      for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you feel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in love with him. You knew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You liked him,&rdquo; insisted Grace patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;loved him. I know. Dear, your theories are sound in a general
      way, but what is a girl going to do about it when she loves a man? You say
      a young girl can't love&mdash;doesn't know how. But I do love, though it
      is true that I don't know how to love very wisely. What is the use in
      denying it? This winter has been a deafening, stupefying fever to me. The
      sheer noise of it stunned me until I forgot how I did feel about anything.
      Then&mdash;I don't know&mdash;somehow, in the rain out there, I began to
      wake... Dear, the old instincts, the old desires, the old truths, came
      back out of chaos; that full feeling here&rdquo;&mdash;she laid her fingers on
      her throat&mdash;&ldquo;the sense of expectancy, the restless hope growing out
      of torpid acquiescence&mdash;all returned; and, dearest, with them all
      came memories of him. What am I to do? Could you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a long while Mrs. Ferrall sat in troubled silence, her hand shading
      her eyes. Sylvia, leaning over her desk, idling with pen and pencil,
      looked around from time to time, as though awaiting the opinion of some
      specialist who, in full possession of the facts, now had become
      responsible for the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you marry him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ferrall quietly, &ldquo;your life will become a
      hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But would it make life any easier for him?&rdquo; asked Sylvia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;to know that you had been dragged down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I mean could I do anything for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No woman ever did. That is a sentimental falsehood of the emotional. No
      woman ever did help a man in that way. Sylvia, if love were the only
      question, and if you do truly love him, I&mdash;well, I suppose I'd be
      fool enough to advise you to be a fool. Even then you'd be sorry. You know
      what your future may be; you know what you are fitted for. What can you do
      without Howard? In this town your rÃ´le would be a very minor one without
      Howard's money, and you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your sacrifice could not help that doomed boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, is there any choice? Is there any question of what to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia looked out into the winter sky, through the tops of snowy trees;
      everywhere the stark, deathly rigidity of winter. Under it, frozen, lay
      the rain that had scented the air. Under her ambition lay the ghosts of
      yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there is no question of choice. I know what must be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace, seated in the firelight, looked up as Sylvia rose from her desk and
      came across the room; and when she sank down on the rug at her feet,
      resting her cheek against the elder woman's knees, nothing was said for a
      long time&mdash;a time of length sufficient to commit a memory to its
      grave, lay it away decently and in quiet befitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sore doubt assailed Grace Ferrall, guiltily aware that once again she had
      meddled; and in the calm tenor of her own placid, marital satisfaction,
      looking backward along the pleasant path she had trodden with its little
      monuments to love at decent intervals amid the agreeable monotony of
      content, her heart and conscience misgave her lest she had counselled this
      young girl wrongly, committing her to the arid lovelessness which she
      herself had never known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning there, her fingers lingering in light caress on Sylvia's bright
      hair, for every doubt she brought up argument, to every sentimental
      wavering within her heart she opposed the chilling reason of common sense.
      Destruction to happiness lay in Sylvia's yielding to her caprice for
      Siward. There was other happiness in the world besides the non-essential
      one of love. That must be Sylvia's portion. And after all&mdash;and after
      all, love was a matter of degree; and it was well for Sylvia that she had
      the malady so lightly&mdash;well for her that it had advanced so little,
      lest she suspect what its crowning miracles might be and fall sick of a
      passion for what she had forever lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week or more the snow continued; colder, gloomier weather set in,
      and the impending menace of Ash Wednesday redoubled the social pace,
      culminating in the Westervelt ball on the eve of the forty days. And
      Sylvia had not yet seen Siward or spoken to him again across the
      wilderness of streets and men.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first relaxation of Lent she had instinctively welcomed an
      opportunity for spiritual consolation and a chance to take her spiritual
      bearings; not because of bodily fatigue&mdash;for in the splendour of her
      youthful vigour she did not know what that meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint Berold was a pretty good saint, and his church was patronised by
      Major Belwether's household. The major liked two things high: his game and
      his church. Sylvia cared for neither, but had become habituated to both
      the odours of sanctity and of pheasants; so to Saint Berold's she went in
      cure of her soul. Besides, she was fond of Father Curtis, who, if he were
      every inch a priest, was also every foot of his six feet a man&mdash;simple,
      good, and brave.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, she found little opportunity, save at her brief confession, for a
      word with Father Curtis. His days were full days to the overbrimming, and
      a fashionable pack was ever at his heels, fawning and shoving and
      importuning. It was fashionable to adore Father Curtis, and for that
      reason she shrank from venturing any demand upon his time, and nobody else
      at Saint Berold's appealed to her. Besides, the music was hard,
      commonplace, even blatant at times, and, having a delicate ear, she shrank
      from this also. It is probable then that what comfort she found under
      Saint Berold's big, brand-new Episcopal cross she extracted from observing
      the rites, usages, and laws of a creed that had been accepted for her by
      that Christian gentleman, Major Belwether. Also, she may have found some
      solace from the still intervals devoted to an inventory of her sins and
      the wistful searching of a heart too young for sadness. If she did it was
      her own affair, not Grace Ferrall's, who went with her to Saint Berold's
      determined always to confess to too much gambling, but letting it go from
      day to day so that the penance could not interfere with the next sÃ©ance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agatha Caithness was there a great deal, looking like a saint in her
      subdued plumage; and very devout, dodging nothing&mdash;neither confession
      nor Quarrier's occasionally lifted eyes, though their gaze, meeting,
      seemed lost in dreamy devotion or drowned in the contemplation of the
      spiritual and remote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank came docilely from his Dutch Reformed church to sit beside Leila. As
      for Mortimer, once a vestryman, he never came at all&mdash;made no
      pretence or profession of what he elegantly expressed as &ldquo;caring a damn&rdquo;
       for anything &ldquo;in the church line,&rdquo; though, he added, there were &ldquo;some good
      lookers to be found in a few synagogues.&rdquo; His misconception of the
      attractions of the church amused the new set of men among whom he had
      recently drifted, to the unfeigned disgust of gentlemen like Major
      Belwether; &ldquo;club&rdquo; men, in the commoner and more sinister interpretation of
      the word; unfit men, who had managed to slip into good clubs; men, once
      fit, who had deteriorated to the verge of ostracism; heavy, over-fed,
      idle, insolent men in questionable financial situation, hard card players,
      hard drinkers, hard riders, negative in their virtues, merciless in their
      vices, and whose cynical misconduct formed the sources of the stock of
      stories told where such men foregather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer had already furnished his world with sufficient material for
      jests of that flavour; now they were telling a new one: how, as Leila was
      standing before Tiffany's looking for her carriage, a masher accosted her,
      and, at her haughty stare, said sneeringly: &ldquo;Oh, you can't play that game
      on me; I've seen you with Leroy Mortimer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The story was repeated frequently enough. Leila heard it with a shrug; but
      such things mattered to her now, and she cried over it at night, burning
      that Plank should hear her name used jestingly to emphasise the depth of
      her husband's degradation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer stayed out at night very frequently now. Also, he appeared to
      make his money go farther, or was luckier at his &ldquo;card killings,&rdquo; because
      he seldom attempted to bully Leila, being apparently content with his
      allowance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice Plank saw him with an unusually attractive girl belonging to
      a world very far removed from Leila's. Somebody said she was an actress
      when she did anything at all&mdash;one Lydia Vyse, somewhat celebrated for
      an audacity not too delicate. But Plank was no more interested than any
      man who can't afford to endanger his prospects by a closer acquaintance
      with that sort of pretty woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mortimer kept away from home, wife, and church, and Plank
      frequented them, so the two men did not meet very often; and the less they
      met the less they found to say to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the forty days had really begun, Major Belwether became restless
      for the flesh-pots of the south, although Lenten duties sat lightly enough
      upon the house of Belwether. These decent observances were limited to a
      lax acknowledgment of fast days, church in moderation, and active
      participation in the succession of informal affairs calculated to sustain
      life in those intellectually atrophied and wealthy people entirely
      dependent upon others for their amusements.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these people no fear of punishment hereafter can equal the terror of
      being left to their own devices; and so, though the opera was over,
      theatres unfashionable, formal functions suspended and dances ended, the
      pace still continued at a discreet and decorous trot; and those who had
      not fled to California or Palm Beach, remained to pray and play Bridge
      with an unction most edifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all this while Sylvia had not seen Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia was changing. The characteristic amiability, the sensitive reserve,
      the sweet composure which the world had always counted on in her, had
      become exceptions and no longer the rules which governed the caprice and
      impulse always latent. An indifference so pointed as to verge on insolence
      amazed her intimates at times; a sudden, flushed impatience startled the
      habituÃ©s of her shrine. There was a new, unseeing hardness in her eyes; in
      her attitude the faintest hint of cynicism. She acquired a habit of doing
      selfish things coldly, indifferent to the canons of the art; and true
      selfishness, the most delicate of all the arts, requires an expert.
    </p>
    <p>
      That which had most charmed&mdash;her unfeigned pleasure in pleasure, her
      unfailing consideration for all, her gentleness with ignorance, her
      generous unconsciousness of self&mdash;all these still remained, it is
      true, though no longer characteristic, no longer to be counted on.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time a slight sense of fear tinctured the general
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      In public her indifference and growing impatience with Quarrier had not
      reached the verge of bad taste, but in private she was scarcely at pains
      to conceal her weariness and inattention, showing him less and less of the
      formal consideration which had been their only medium of coexistence. That
      he noticed it was evident even to her who carelessly ignored the
      consequences of her own attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, speaking of the alterations in progress at The Sedges, his place
      near Oyster Bay, he casually asked her opinion, and she as casually
      observed that if he had an opinion about anything he wouldn't know what to
      do with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, too, she had remarked in Quarrier's hearing to Ferrall, who was
      complaining about the loss of his hair, that a hairless head was a
      visitation from Heaven, but a beard was a man's own fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once they came very close to a definite rupture, close enough to scare her
      after all the heat had gone out of her and the matter was ended. Quarrier
      had lingered late after cards, and something was said about the impending
      kennel show and about Marion Page judging the English setters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agatha tells me that you are going with Marion,&rdquo; continued Quarrier. &ldquo;As
      long as Marion has chosen to make herself conspicuous there is nothing to
      be said. But do you think it very good taste for you to figure publicly on
      the sawdust with an eccentric girl like Marion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see nothing conspicuous about a girl's judging a few dogs,&rdquo; said
      Sylvia, merely from an irritable desire to contradict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's bad taste and bad form,&rdquo; remarked Quarrier coldly; &ldquo;and Agatha
      thought it a mistake for you to go there with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agatha's opinions do not concern me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps mine may have some weight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the slightest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said patiently: &ldquo;This is a public show; do you understand? Not one of
      those private bench exhibitions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand. Really, Howard, you are insufferable at times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you feel that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do. I am sorry to be rude, but I do feel that way!&rdquo; Flushed,
      impatient, she looked him squarely between his narrowing, woman's eyes: &ldquo;I
      do not care for you very much, Howard, and you know it. I am marrying you
      with a perfectly sordid motive, and you know that, too. Therefore it is
      more decent&mdash;if there is any decency left in either of us&mdash;to
      interfere with one another as little as possible, unless you desire a
      definite rupture. Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? A&mdash;a rupture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said hotly; &ldquo;do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, Sylvia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I'm too cowardly, too selfish, too treacherous to myself. No, I
      don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor do I,&rdquo; he said, lifting his furtive eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. You are more contemptible than I am, that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice had grown unsteady; an unreasoning rush of anger had set her
      whole body a-thrill, and the white heat of it was driving her to provoke
      him, as though that might cleanse her of the ignominy of the bargain&mdash;as
      though a bargain did not require two of the same mind to make it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want of me?&rdquo; she said, still stinging under the angry waves
      of self-contempt. &ldquo;What are you marrying me for? Because, divided, we are
      likely to cut small figures in our tin-trumpet world? Because, united, we
      can dominate the brainless? Is there any other reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Showing his teeth in that twitching snicker that contracted the muscles of
      his upper lip: &ldquo;Children!&rdquo; he said, looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned scarlet to her hair; the deliberate grossness stunned her.
      Confused, she stood confronting him, dumb under a retort the coarseness of
      which she had never dreamed him capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean what I say,&rdquo; he repeated calmly. &ldquo;A man cares for two things: his
      fortune, and the heirs to it. If you didn't know that you have learned it
      now. You hurt me deliberately. I told you a plain truth very bluntly. It
      is for you to consider the situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she could not speak; anger, humiliation, shame, held her tongue-tied.
      The instinctive revolt at the vague horror&mdash;the monstrous,
      meaningless threat&mdash;nothing could force words from her to repudiate,
      to deny what he had dared to utter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except as the effrontery of brutality, except as a formless menace born of
      his anger, the reason he flung at her for his marrying her conveyed
      nothing to her in its grotesque impossibility. Only the intentional
      coarseness of it was to be endured&mdash;if she chose to endure it; for
      the rest was empty of concrete meaning to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lent was half over before she saw him again. Neither he nor she had taken
      any steps to complete the rupture; and at the Mi-carÃªme dance, given by
      the Siowa Hunt, Quarrier, who was M. F. H., took up the thread of their
      suspended intercourse as methodically and calmly as though it had never
      quivered to the breaking point. He led the cotillon with agreeable
      precision and impersonal accuracy, favouring her at intervals; and though
      she wasted no favours on him, she endured his, which was sufficient
      evidence that matters were still in statu quo.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to town next morning with Grace Ferrall, irritable, sulky,
      furious with herself at the cowardly relief she felt. For, spite of her
      burning anger against Quarrier, the suspense at times had been wearing;
      and she would not make the first move&mdash;had not decided even to accept
      his move if it came&mdash;at least, had not admitted to herself that she
      would accept it. It had come and the tension was over, and now, entering
      Mrs. Ferrall's brougham which met them at Thirty-fourth Street Ferry, she
      was furious with herself for her unfeigned feeling of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      All hot with self-contempt she lay back in the comfortably upholstered
      corner of the brougham, staring straight before her, sullen red mouth
      unresponsive to the occasional inconsequent questions of Grace Ferrall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After awhile,&rdquo; observed Grace, &ldquo;people will begin to talk about the
      discontented beauty of your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia's eyebrows bent still farther inward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fretful face, but rather pretty,&rdquo; commented Grace maliciously. &ldquo;It
      won't do, dear. Your rÃ´le is dignified comedy. O dear! O my!&rdquo; She stifled
      a yawn behind her faultlessly gloved hand. &ldquo;I'm feeling these late hours
      in my aged bones. It wasn't much of a dance, was it? Or am I
      disillusioned? Certainly that Edgeworth boy fell in love with me&mdash;the
      depraved creature&mdash;trying his primitive wiles there in the
      conservatory! Little beast! There are no nice boys any more; they're all
      too young or too sophisticated.... Howard does lead well, I admit that....
      You're on the box seat together again I see. Pooh! I wasn't a bit
      alarmed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was,&rdquo; said Sylvia, curling her lip in biting self-contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's a wholesome confession, anyway. O dear, how I do yawn! and
      Lent only half over.... Sylvia, what are you staring at? Oh, I&mdash;see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had driven south to Washington Square, where Mrs. Ferrall had desired
      to leave a note, and were now returning. Sylvia had leaned forward to look
      up at Siward's house, but with Mrs. Ferrall's first word she sank back,
      curiously expressionless and white; for she had seen a woman entering the
      front door and had recognised her as Marion Page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of all indiscretions!&rdquo; breathed Grace, looking helplessly at
      Sylvia. &ldquo;Oh, no, that sort of thing is sheer effrontery, you know! It's
      rotten bad taste; it's no worse, of course&mdash;but it's bad taste. I
      don't care what privileges we concede to Marion, we're not going to
      concede this&mdash;unless she puts on trousers for good. It's all very
      well for her to talk her plain kennel talk, and call spades by their
      technical names, and smoke all over people's houses, and walk all over
      people's prejudices; but there's no sense in her hunting for trouble; and
      she'll get it, sure as scandal is scandal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And still Sylvia remained pale and silent, eyes downcast, shrinking close
      into her upholstered corner, as though some reflex instinct of
      self-concealment was still automatically dominating her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ought to be spanked!&rdquo; said Grace viciously. &ldquo;If she were my daughter
      I'd do it, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia did not stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little idiot! Going into a man's house in the face of all Fifth Avenue
      and the teeth of decency!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has courage,&rdquo; said Sylvia, still very white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage! Do you mean fool-hardiness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, courage&mdash;the courage I lacked. I knew he was too ill to leave
      his room and I lacked the courage to go and see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dare tell me you ever contemplated&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. I think I should have done it yet, but&mdash;but Marion&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she bent forward, resting her face in her hands; and between the
      fingers a bright drop ran, glimmered, and fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; breathed Mrs. Ferrall, and sank back, nerveless, into her own
      corner of the rocking brougham.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII THE ASKING PRICE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Siward, at his desk, over which the May sunshine streamed, his crutches
      laid against his chair, sat poring over the piles of papers left there by
      Beverly Plank some days before with a curt recommendation that he master
      their contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the papers were typewritten, some appeared to be engraved
      certificates of stock, a few were in Plank's heavy, squat handwriting.
      There were several packages tied in pink tape, evidently legal papers of
      some sort; and also a pile of scrap-books containing newspaper clippings
      to which Siward referred occasionally, or read them at length, resting his
      thin, fatigued face between two bony hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curious persistence of youth in his features seemed unaccountable in
      view of the heavy marks imprinted there; but they were marks, not lines;
      bluish hollows under eyes still young, marred contours of the cheek-bone;
      a hardness about the hollow temples above which his short, bright hair
      clustered with all its soft, youthful allure undimmed; and in every
      movement, every turn of his head, there still remained much of that
      indefinable attractiveness which had always characterised his race&mdash;much
      of the unconscious charm usually known as breeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      In men of Mortimer's fibre, dissipation produced coarser symptoms&mdash;distended
      veins, and sagging flesh&mdash;where in Siward it seemed to bruise and
      harden, driving the colour of blood out of him and leaving the pallor of
      marble, and the bluish shadows of it staining the hollows. Only the eyes
      had begun to change radically; something in them had been quenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he could never hope to become immune he had learned at last when he
      had returned, physically wholesome, from his long course of training under
      the famous Irish specialist on the Hudson. He had expected to be immune,
      spite of the blunt and forcible language of Mulqueen when he turned him
      out into the world again:

      &ldquo;Ye'll be afther notin',&rdquo; said Mr. Mulqueen, &ldquo;that a poonch in the plexis
      putts a man out; but it don't kill him. That's you! Whin a man mixes it up
      wid the booze, l'ave him come here an' I'll tache him a thrick. But it's
      not murther I tache; it's the hook on the jaw that shtops, an' the poonch
      in the plexis that putts the booze-divil on the bum! L'ave him take the
      count; he'll niver rise to the chune o' the bell av ye l'ave him lie. But
      he ain't dead, Misther Sayward; mark that, me son! An' don't ye be afther
      sayin', 'Th' inimy is down an' out fur good! Pore lad! Sure, I'll shake
      hands over a dhrink wid him, for he can do me no hurrt anny more!' No,
      sorr! L'ave him lie, an' l'ave the years av ver life count him out; fur
      the day you die, he dies, an' not wan shake o' the mixer sooner! G'wan,
      now, fur the rub-down. Ye've faught yer lasht round, if ye ain't a fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had been a fool. He had imagined that he could control himself, and
      practise the moderation that other men practised when they chose. The
      puerile restraint annoyed him; his implied inability to master himself
      humiliated him, the more so because, secretly, he was horribly afraid in
      the remote depths of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exactly how it happened he did not remember, except that he had gone down
      town on business and had lunched with several men. There was claret. Later
      he remembered another cafÃ©, farther up town, and another, more brilliantly
      lighted. After that there were vague hours&mdash;the fierce fever of
      debauch wrapping night and day in flame through which he moved, unseeing,
      unheeding, deafened, drenched soul and body in the living fire; or
      dreaming, feeling the subsiding fury of desire pulse and ebb and flow,
      rocking him to unconsciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father's old servants had found him again, this time in the area; and
      this time the same ankle, not yet strong, had been broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the waning winter days, as he lay brooding in bitterness,
      realising that it was all to do over again, Plank's shy visits became
      gradually part of the routine. But it was many days before Siward
      perceived in the big, lumbering, pink-fisted man anything to attract him
      beyond the faintly amused curiosity of one man for another who is in
      process of establishing himself as the first of a race.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for reciprocation in other forms except the most superficial, or of
      permitting a personal note to sound ever so discreetly, Siward tolerated
      no such idea. Even the tentative advances of Plank hinting on willingness,
      and perhaps ability, to help Siward in the Amalgamated tangle were
      pleasantly ignored. Unpaid services rendered by men like Plank were
      impossible; any obligation to Plank was utterly out of the question.
      Meanwhile they began to like one another&mdash;at least Siward often found
      himself looking forward with pleasure to a visit from Plank. There had
      never been any question of the latter's attitude toward Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank began to frequent the house, but never informally. It is doubtful
      whether he could have practised informality in that house even at Siward's
      invitation. Something of the attitude of a college lower classman for a
      man in a class above seemed to typify their relations; and that feeling is
      never entirely eradicated between men, no matter how close their
      relationship in after-life.
    </p>
    <p>
      One very bad night Plank came to the house and was admitted by Gumble.
      Wands, the second man, stood behind the aged butler; both were apparently
      frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      That something was amiss appeared plainly enough; and Plank, instinctively
      producing a card, dropped it on a table and turned to go. It may have been
      that the old butler recognised the innate delicacy of the motive, or it
      may have been a sudden confidence born of the necessities of the case, for
      he asked Plank to see his young master.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Plank, looking him in the eyes, considered, until his courage began to
      fail. Then he went up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bad night outside, and it was a bad night for Siward. The
      master-vice had him by the throat. He sat there, clutching the arms of his
      chair, his broken leg, in its plaster casing, extended in front of him;
      and when he saw Plank enter he glared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hour after hour the two men sat there, the one white with rage, but
      helpless; the other, stolid, inert, deaf to demands for intercession with
      the arch-vice, dumb under pleadings for a compromise. He refused to
      interfere with the butler, and Siward insulted him. He refused to go and
      find the decanters himself, and Siward deliberately cursed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the storm raged all night. Inside that house Plank faced a more
      awful tempest. There was a sedative on the mantel and he offered it to
      Siward, who struck it from his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, toward morning, Siward feigned sleep, and Plank, heavy head on his
      breast, feigned it, too. Then Siward bent over stealthily and opened a
      drawer in his desk; and Plank was on his feet like a flash, jerking the
      morphine from Siward's fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor arrived at daylight, responding to Plank's summons by
      telephone, and Plank went away with the morphine and Siward's revolver
      bulging in the side-pockets of his dinner coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not come again for a week. A short note from Siward started him
      toward lower Fifth Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was little said when he came into the room:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Plank! Glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! Are you all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.... Much obliged for pulling me through. Wish you'd pull me
      through this Amalgamated Electric knot-hole, too&mdash;some day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do&mdash;do you mean it?&rdquo; ventured Plank, turning red with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean it? Indeed I do&mdash;if you do. Sit here; ring for whatever you
      want&mdash;or perhaps you'd better go down to the sideboard. I'm not to be
      trusted with the odour in the room just yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care for anything,&rdquo; said Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever you please, then. You know the house, and you don't mind my
      being unceremonious, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; rejoined Siward, laughing. &ldquo;I expect the same friendly lack of
      ceremony from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But that, for Plank, was impossible. All he could do was to care the more
      for Siward without crossing the border line so suddenly made free; all he
      could do was to sit there rolling and unrolling his gloves into wads with
      his clumsy, highly coloured hands, and gaze consciously at everything in
      the room except Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that day, at Plank's shy suggestion, they talked over Siward's business
      affairs for the first time. After that day, and for many days, the subject
      became the key-note to their intercourse; and Siward at last understood
      that this man desired to do him a service absolutely and purely from a
      disinterested liking for him, and as an expression of that liking. Also he
      was unexpectedly made aware of Plank's serenely unerring business
      sagacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      That surface cynicism which all must learn, sooner or later, or remain the
      victims of naive credulity, was, in Siward, nothing but an outer skin, as
      it is in all who acquire wisdom with their cynicism. It was not long proof
      against Plank's simple attitude and undisguised pleasure in doing
      something for a man he liked. Under that simplicity no motive, no
      self-interest could skulk; and Siward knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the quid pro quo, Siward had insisted from the first on a business
      arrangement. The treachery of Major Belwether through sheer fright had
      knocked the key-stone from the syndicate, and the dam which made the
      golden pool possible collapsed, showering Plank's brokers who worked
      patiently with buckets and mops.
    </p>
    <p>
      The double treachery of Quarrier was now perfectly apparent to Plank.
      Siward, true to his word, held his stock in the face of ruin. Kemp
      Ferrall, furious with the major, and beginning to suspect Quarrier, came
      to Plank for consultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the defence formed under Plank. Legal machinery was set in motion,
      meeting followed meeting, until Harrington cynically showed his hand and
      Quarrier smiled his rare smile; and the fight against Inter-County was on
      in the open, preceded by a furious clamour of charge and counter-charge in
      the columns of the daily press.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Quarrier had been guilty of something or other was the vague
      impression of that great news-reading public which, stunned by the
      reiteration of figures in the millions, turns to the simpler pleasures of
      a murder trial. Besides, whatever Quarrier had done was no doubt done
      within the chalk-marked courts of the game, though probably his shoes may
      have become a little dusty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But who could hope to bring players like Quarrier before the ordinary
      umpire, or to investigate his methods with the everyday investigations
      reserved for everyday folk, whose road through business life lay always
      between State's prison and the penitentiary and whose guide-posts were
      policemen?
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the great syndicates join in battle; they could only slay each other.
      Let the millions bury their millions; the public, though poorer, could
      never be the wiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Siward, at his desk, the May sunshine pouring over him, sat conning the
      heaps of typewritten sheets, striving to see between the lines some sign
      of fortune for his investments, some promise of release from the
      increasing financial stringency, some chance of justice being done on
      those high priests who had been performing marvellous tricks upon their
      altar so that by miracle, mine and thine spelled &ldquo;ours,&rdquo; and all the
      tablets of the law were lettered upside down and hind-side before, like
      the Black Mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gumble knocked presently. Siward raised his perplexed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Page, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Siward doubtfully; then, &ldquo;Ask Miss Page to come up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marion strolled in a moment later, exchanged a vigorous hand shake with
      Siward, pulled up a chair and dropped into it. She was in riding-habit and
      boots, faultlessly groomed as usual, her smooth, pale hair sleek in its
      thick knot, collar and tie immaculate as her gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;any news of your ankle, Stephen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I inquired about my ankle,&rdquo; said Siward, amused, &ldquo;and they tell me it is
      better, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit a horse pretty soon?&rdquo; she asked, dropping one leg over the other and
      balancing the riding-crop across her knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for awhile. You have a fine day for a gallop, Marion,&rdquo; looking
      askance at the sunshine filtering through the first green leaves of the
      tree outside his window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right&mdash;the day. I'm trying Tom O'Hara's new mare. They say
      she's a little devil. I never saw a devil of a horse&mdash;did you? There
      may be some out West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't break that pretty neck of yours, Marion,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her eyes; then, briefly, &ldquo;No fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There's no use looking for trouble in a horse.
      Women who hunt as you hunt take all that's legitimately coming to them.
      Why doesn't Tom ride his own mare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She rolled on him,&rdquo; said Marion simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. Is he hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ribs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he's lucky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't he! He'll miss a few drills with his precious squadron, that's
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was looking about her, preoccupied. &ldquo;Where are your cigarettes,
      Stephen? Oh, I see. Don't try to move&mdash;don't be silly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned over the desk, her fresh young face close to his, and reached
      for the cigarettes. The clean-cut head, the sweetness of her youth and
      femininity, boyish in its allure, were very attractive to him&mdash;more
      so, perhaps, because of his isolation from the atmosphere of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all very well, Marion, your coming here&mdash;and it's very sweet of
      you, and I enjoy it immensely,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;but it's a deuced imprudent
      thing for you to do, and I feel bound to say so for your sake every time
      you come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned back in her chair and coolly blew a wreath of smoke at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, unconvinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly it's all right. I've done what suited me all my life. This
      suits me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It suits me, too,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;only I wish you'd tell your mother before
      somebody around this neighbourhood informs her first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let 'em. You'll be out by that time. Do you think I'm going to tell my
      mother now and have her stop it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marion, you know perfectly well that it won't do for a girl to ignore
      first principles. I'm horribly afraid somebody will talk about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; he asked, disturbed. &ldquo;What could I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I suppose,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;you'd have to marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he rejoined with a laugh, &ldquo;I should think you'd be scared into
      prudence by the prospect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not easily&mdash;scared,&rdquo; she said, looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at that prospect?&rdquo; he said jestingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him; and he remembered afterward the poise of her small
      head, and the slow, clear colour mounting; remembered that it conveyed to
      him, somehow, a hint of courage and sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not frightened,&rdquo; she said gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gravity fell upon him, too. In this young girl's eyes there was no
      evasion. For a long while he had felt vaguely that matters were not
      perfectly balanced between them. At moments, even, he had felt an
      indefinable uneasiness in her presence. The situation troubled him, too;
      and though he had known her from childhood and had long ago learned to
      discount her vagaries of informality, her manners sans faÃ§on, her careless
      ignoring of convention, and the unembarrassed terms of her speech, his
      common-sense could not countenance this defiance of social usage, sure to
      involve even such a privileged girl as she in some unpleasantness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This troubled him; and now, partly sceptical, yet partly conscious, too,
      of her very frank liking for himself, he looked at her, perplexed,
      apprehensive, unwilling to credit her with any deeper meaning than her
      words expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had grown pink and restless under his gaze, using her cigarette
      frequently, and continually flicking the ashes to the floor, until the
      little finger of her glove was blackened.
    </p>
    <p>
      But courage characterised her race. It had required more than he knew for
      her to come into his house; and now that she was there loyalty to her
      professed principles&mdash;that a man and a woman were by right endowed
      with equal privileges&mdash;forced her to face the consequences of her
      theory in the practise.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had, with calm face and quivering heart, given him an opening. That
      was a concession to her essential womanhood and a cowardice on her part;
      and, lest she turn utterly traitor to herself, she faced him again, cool,
      quiet, and terror in her heart:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd be very glad to marry you&mdash;if you c-cared to,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;I&mdash;it is&mdash;of course it's a joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I'm serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serious! Nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don't say that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, appalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&mdash;but you don't love&mdash;can't be in love with me!&rdquo; he
      stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gloved hands tightening on either end of her riding-crop, she bent her
      knee against it, balancing there, looking straight at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant to tell you so,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if you didn't tell me first. So&mdash;I
      was rather&mdash;tired waiting. So I've told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only a fancy,&rdquo; he said, scarcely knowing what he was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so, Stephen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he could not meet her candour, and he sat, silent, miserable, staring
      at the papers on his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while she drew a deep, even breath, and rose to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marion&mdash;I never dreamed that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should dream truer,&rdquo; she said. There was a suspicion of mist in her
      clear eyes; she turned abruptly to the window and stood there for a few
      moments, looking down at her brougham waiting in front of the house. &ldquo;It
      can't be helped, can it!&rdquo; she said, turning suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found no answer to her question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she said, walking to him with outstretched hand; &ldquo;it's all in
      a lifetime, Steve, and that's too short for a good, clean friendship like
      ours to die in. I don't think I'd better come again. Look me up for a
      gallop when you're fit. And you might drop me a line to say how you're
      getting on. Is it all right, Stephen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their hands tightened in a crushing clasp; then she swung on her spurred
      heel and walked out, leaving him haggard, motionless. He heard the front
      door close, and he swayed forward, dropping his face in his hands, arms
      half buried among the papers on his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank found him there, an hour later, fumbling among the papers, and at
      first feared that he read in Siward's drawn and sullen face a premonition
      of the ever-dreaded symptoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quarrier has telephoned asking for a conference at last,&rdquo; he said
      abruptly, sitting down beside Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; inquired Siward, &ldquo;how do you interpret that&mdash;favourably?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am inclined to think he is a bit uneasy,&rdquo; said Plank cautiously.
      &ldquo;Harrington made a secret trip to Albany last week. You didn't know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he did. It looks to me as though there were going to be a ghost of
      a chance for an investigation. That is how I am inclined to consider
      Harrington's trip and Quarrier's flag of truce. But&mdash;I don't know.
      There's nothing definite, of course. You are as conversant with the
      situation as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not. That is like you, Plank, to ascribe to me the same business
      sense that you possess, but I haven't got it. It's very nice and
      considerate of you, but I haven't it, and you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so because you think generously. That doesn't alter the facts.
      Now tell me what you have concluded that we ought to do and I'll say
      'Amen,' as usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank laughed, and looked over several sheets of the typewritten matter on
      the desk beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I meet Quarrier?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Did he suggest a date?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At four, this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you had better go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it might do no harm,&rdquo; said Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; observed Siward, laughing, and touched the electric button for the
      early tea, which Plank adored at any hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while they dropped business and discussed their tea, chatting very
      comfortably together. Long ago Siward had found out something of the
      mental breadth of the man beside him, and that he was worth listening to
      as well as talking to. For Plank had formed opinions upon a great many
      subjects; and whatever culture he possessed was from sheer desire for
      self-cultivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, Siward,&rdquo; he was accustomed to say with a smile, &ldquo;you inherit
      what I am qualifying myself to transmit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be all one in a thousand years,&rdquo; was Siward's usual rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not going to prevent my efforts to become a good ancestor to my
      descendants,&rdquo; Plank would say laughingly. &ldquo;They shall have a chance, every
      one of them. And it will be up to them if they don't make good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sipping their tea in the pleasant, sunny room, they discussed matters of
      common interest&mdash;Plank's recent fishing trip on Long Island and the
      degeneracy of liver-fed trout; the North Side Club's Experiments with
      European partridges; Billy Fleetwood's new stables; forestry, and the
      chance of national legislation concerning it&mdash;a subject of which
      Plank was very fond, and on which he had exceedingly sound ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drifting from one topic to another through the haze of their cigars,
      silent when it pleased them to be so, there could be no doubt of their
      liking for each other upon a basis at least superficially informal; and if
      Plank's manner retained at times a shade of quaint reserve, Siward's was
      perhaps the more frankly direct for that reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; observed Plank, laying his half-consumed cigar on the silver
      tray, &ldquo;that I'd better go down town and see what our pre-glacial friend
      Quarrier wants. I may be able to furnish him with a new sensation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if Quarrier ever experienced a genuine sensation,&rdquo; mused Siward,
      arranging the papers before him into divisional piles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; said Plank drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; repeated Plank. &ldquo;It's your thin-lipped, thin-nosed, pasty-pale,
      symmetrical brother who is closer to the animal under his mask than any of
      us imagine. I&mdash;&rdquo; He hesitated. &ldquo;Do you want to know my opinion of
      Quarrier? I've never told you. I don't usually talk about my&mdash;dislikes.
      Do you want to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Siward curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, first of all, he is a sentimentalist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; jeered Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sentimentalist of the weakest type,&rdquo; continued Plank obstinately;
      &ldquo;because he sentimentalises over himself. Siward, look out for the man
      with elaborate whiskers! Look out for a pallid man with eccentric hair and
      a silky beard! He's a sentimentalist of the sort I told you, and is
      usually utterly remorseless in his dealings with women. I suppose you
      think me a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Quarrier is indifferent concerning women,&rdquo; said Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong. He is a sensualist,&rdquo; insisted Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Plank&mdash;not that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sensualist. His sentimental vanity he lavishes upon himself&mdash;the
      animal in him on women. His caution, born of self-consideration, is the
      caution of a beast. Such men as he believe they live in the focus of a
      million eyes. Part of his vanity is to deceive those eyes and be what he
      is under the mask he wears; and to do that one must be the very master of
      caution. That is Quarrier's vanity. To conceal, is his monomania.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot see how you draw that conclusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Siward, he is a bad man, and crafty&mdash;every inch of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, now! Only characters in fiction have no saving qualities. You
      never heard of anybody in real life being entirely bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn't; and Quarrier isn't. For example, he is kind to valuable
      animals&mdash;I mean, his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good to animals! The bad man's invariable characteristic!&rdquo; laughed
      Siward. &ldquo;I'm kind to 'em, too. What else is he good to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody knows that he hasn't a poor relation left; not one. He is loyal
      to them in a rare way; he filled one subsidiary company full of them. It
      is known down town as the 'Home for Destitute Nephews.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seriously, Plank, the man must have something good in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of your theory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I believe that nobody is entirely bad. So do the great masters of
      fiction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank said gravely: &ldquo;He is a good son to his father. That is perfectly
      true&mdash;kind, considerate, dutiful, loyal. The financial world is
      perfectly aware that Stanley Quarrier is to-day the most unscrupulous old
      scoundrel who ever crushed a refinery or debauched a railroad! and his son
      no more believes it than he credits the scandalous history of the Red
      Woman of Wall Street. Why, when I was making arrangements for that chapel
      Quarrier came to me, very much perturbed, because he understood that all
      the memorial chapels for the cathedral had been arranged for, and he had
      desired to build one to the memory of his father! His father! Isn't it
      awful to think of!&mdash;a chapel to the memory of the briber of judges
      and of legislatures, the cynical defier of law!&mdash;this hoary old
      thief, who beggared the widow and stripped the orphan, and whose only
      match, as a great unpunished criminal, was that sinister little
      predecessor of his, who dreamed even of debauching the executive of these
      United States!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward had never before seen Plank aroused, and he said so, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Plank earnestly; &ldquo;I waste little temper over my likes
      and dislikes. But what I know, and what I legitimately infer concerning
      the younger Quarrier is enough to rouse any man's anger. I won't tell you
      what I know. I can't. It has nothing to do with his financial methods,
      nothing to do with this business; but it is bad&mdash;bad all through! The
      blow his father struck at the integrity of the bench the son strikes at
      the very key-stone of all social safeguard. It isn't my business; I cannot
      interfere; but Siward, I'm a damned restless witness, and the old,
      primitive longing comes back on me to strike&mdash;to take a stick and use
      it to splinters on that man whom I am going down town to politely confer
      with!... And I must go now. Good-bye.... Take care of that ankle. Any
      books I can send you&mdash;anything you want? No? All right. And don't
      worry over Amalgamated Electric, for I really believe we are beginning to
      frighten them badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said Siward. &ldquo;Don't forget that I'm always at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must get out,&rdquo; muttered Plank; &ldquo;you must get well, and get out into
      the sunshine.&rdquo; And he went ponderously down-stairs to the square hall,
      where Gumble held his hat and gloves ready for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come in a big yellow and black touring-car; and now, with a brief
      word to his mechanic, he climbed into the tonneau, and away they sped down
      town&mdash;a glitter of bull's-eye, brass, and varnish, with the mellow,
      horn notes floating far in their wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was exactly four o'clock when he was ushered into Quarrier's private
      suite in the great marble Algonquin Loan and Trust Building, the upper
      stories of which were all golden in the sun against a sky of sapphire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier was alone, gloved and hatted, as though on the point of leaving.
      He showed a slight surprise at seeing Plank, as if he had not been
      expecting him; and the manner of offering his hand subtly emphasised it as
      he came forward with a trace of inquiry in his greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said four o'clock, I believe,&rdquo; observed Plank bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes. It was about that&mdash;ah&mdash;matter&mdash;ah&mdash;I beg
      your pardon; can you recollect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what it is you want. You requested this meeting,&rdquo; said
      Plank, yawning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I recollect it perfectly now. Will you sit here, Mr. Plank&mdash;for
      a moment&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it concerns Inter-County, it will take longer than a moment&mdash;unless
      you cannot spare the time now,&rdquo; said Plank. &ldquo;Shall we call it off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of fact I am rather short of time just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us postpone it. I shall probably be at my office if you are
      anxious to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier looked at him, then laid aside his hat and sat down. There was
      little to be done in diplomacy with an oaf like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Plank,&rdquo; he said, without any emphasis at all, &ldquo;there should be some
      way for us to come together. Have you considered it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven't,&rdquo; replied Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, for you and me to try to understand each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For us?&rdquo; asked Plank, raising his blond eyebrows. &ldquo;Do you mean
      Amalgamated Electric and Inter-County, impersonally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean for us, personally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no way,&rdquo; said Plank, with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wasting time thinking it, Mr. Quarrier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier's velvet-fringed eyes began to narrow, but his calm voice
      remained unchanged: &ldquo;We are merely wasting energy in this duel,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; I don't feel wasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are also wasting opportunities,&rdquo; continued Quarrier slowly. &ldquo;This
      whole matter is involving us in a tangle of litigation requiring our
      constant effort, constant attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Quarrier, but you take it too seriously. I have
      found, in this affair, nothing except a rather agreeable mental
      exhilaration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Plank, if you are not inclined to be serious&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Plank so savagely that Quarrier, startled, could not doubt
      him. &ldquo;I like this sort of thing, Mr. Quarrier. Anything that is hard to
      overcome, I like to overcome. The pleasure in life, to me, is to win out.
      I am fighting you with the greatest possible satisfaction to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you see victory ahead,&rdquo; said Quarrier calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, Mr. Quarrier, I do. But not in the manner you fear I may hope for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind saying in what manner you are already discounting your
      victory, Mr Plank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't mind telling you. I have no batteries to mask. I don't care
      how much you know about my resources; so I'll tell you what I see, Mr.
      Quarrier. I see a parody of the popular battle between razor-back and
      rattler. The rattler only strives to strike and kill, not to swallow. Mr.
      Quarrier, that old razor-back isn't going home hungry; but&mdash;he's
      going home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I am not familiar enough with the natural history you quote to
      follow you,&rdquo; said Quarrier with a sneer, his long fingers busy with the
      silky point of his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you won't follow me home; you'll come with me, when it's all over.
      Now is it very plain to you, Mr. Quarrier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier said, without emotion: &ldquo;I repeat that it would be easy for you
      and me to merge our differences on a basis absolutely satisfactory to you
      and to me&mdash;and to Harrington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; said Plank, rising. &ldquo;Good afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier rose, too. &ldquo;You decline to discuss the matter?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been discussed sufficiently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see for myself how afraid of me you really are,&rdquo; said Plank. &ldquo;Now I
      know, and so do you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You desire to make it a personal matter?&rdquo; inquired Quarrier, in a low
      voice, his face dead white in the late sunlight which illuminated the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Personal? No&mdash;impersonal; because there could be absolutely nothing
      personal between us, Mr. Quarrier; and the only thing in the world that
      there ought to be between us are a few stout, steel bars. Beg pardon for
      talking shop. I'm a shopkeeper, and I'm in the steel business, and I lack
      opportunities for cultivation. Good day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Plank&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Quarrier, I want to tell you something. Never before, in business
      differences, has private indignation against any individual interfered or
      modified my course of action. It does now; but it does not dictate my
      policy toward you; it merely, as I say, modifies it. I am perfectly aware
      of what I am doing; what social disaster I am inviting by this attitude
      toward you personally; what financial destruction I am courting in
      arousing the wrath of the Algonquin Trust Company and of the powerful
      interests intrenched behind Inter-County Electric. I know what the lobby
      is; I know what judge cannot be counted on; I know my peril and my
      chances, every one; and I take them&mdash;every one. For it is a good
      fight, Mr. Quarrier; it will be talked of for years to come, wonderingly;
      not because of your effrontery, not because of my obstinacy, but because
      such monstrous immorality could ever have existed in this land of ours.
      Your name, Harrington's, mine, will have become utterly forgotten long,
      long before the horror of these present conditions shall cease to be
      remembered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stretched out one ponderous arm, pointing full between Quarrier's
      unwinking eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your fighting chance&mdash;it is the cleanest thing you ever
      touched; and use it cleanly, or there'll be no mercy shown you when your
      time comes. Let the courts alone&mdash;do you hear me? Let the legislature
      alone. Keep your manicured hands off the ermine. And tell Harrington to
      shove his own cold, splay fingers into his own pockets for a change.
      They'll be warmer than his feet by this time next year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he towered there, powerful, bulky, menacing; then his arm
      dropped heavily&mdash;the old stolid expression came back into his face,
      leaving it calm, bovine, almost stupid again. And he turned, moving slowly
      toward the door, holding his hat carefully in his gloved hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stepping out of the elevator on the ground floor he encountered Mortimer,
      and halted instinctively. He had not seen Mortimer for weeks; neither had
      Leila; and now he looked at him inquiringly, disturbed at his battered and
      bloodshot appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mortimer, &ldquo;you down here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been out of town?&rdquo; asked Plank cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer nodded, and started to pass on toward the bronze cage of the
      elevator, but something seemed to occur to him suddenly; he checked his
      pace, turned, and waddled after Plank, rejoining him on the marble steps
      of the rotunda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he panted, holding Plank by the elbow and breathing heavily
      even after the short chase across the lobby, &ldquo;I meant to tell you
      something. Come over here and sit down a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still grasping Plank's elbow in his puffy fingers, he directed him toward
      a velvet seat in a corner of the lobby; and here they sat down, while
      Mortimer mopped his fat neck with his handkerchief, swearing at the heat
      under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I promised you something once, didn't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; said Plank, with his bland, expressionless stare of an
      overgrown baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, cut that out! You know damn well I did; and when I say a thing I make
      good. D'ye see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see,&rdquo; said Plank, &ldquo;what you are talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm talking about what I said I'd do for you. Haven't I made good?
      Haven't I put you into everything I said I would? Don't you go everywhere?
      Don't people ask you everywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;in a way,&rdquo; said Plank wearily. &ldquo;I am very grateful; I always
      will be.... Can I do anything for you, Leroy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer became indignant at the implied distrust of the purity of his
      motives; and Plank, failing to stem the maudlin tirade, relapsed into
      patient silence, speculating within himself as to what it could be that
      Mortimer wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came out presently. Mortimer had attended a &ldquo;killing&rdquo; at Desmond's,
      and, as usual, had provided the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance for his soft-voiced
      host. All he wanted was a temporary deposit to tide over matters. He had
      never approached Plank in vain, and he did not do so now, for Plank had a
      pocket cheque-book and a stylograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's damn little to ask, isn't it?&rdquo; he muttered resentfully. &ldquo;That will
      only square matters with Desmond; it doesn't leave me anything to go on
      with,&rdquo; and he pocketed his cheque with a scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank was discreetly silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is not what I chased you for, either,&rdquo; continued Mortimer. &ldquo;I
      didn't intend to say anything about Desmond; I was going to fix it in
      another way!&rdquo; He cast an involuntary and sinister glance at the elevators
      gliding ceaselessly up and down at the end of the vast marble rotunda;
      then his protruding eyes sought Plank's again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beverly, old boy, I've got a certain mealy-faced hypocrite where any
      decent man would like to have him&mdash;by the scruff of his neck. He's
      fit only to kick; and I'm going to kick him good and plenty; and in the
      process he's going to let go of several things.&rdquo; Mortimer leered, pleased
      with his own similes, then added rather hastily: &ldquo;I mean, he's going to
      drop several things that don't belong to him. Leave it to me to shake him
      down; he'll drop them all right.... One of 'em's yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you once that I'd let you know when to step up and say 'Good
      evening' didn't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank continued to stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't I?&rdquo; repeated Mortimer peevishly, beginning to lose countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand you,&rdquo; said Plank, &ldquo;and I don't think I want to
      understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Mortimer thickly; &ldquo;don't you want to marry
      that girl!&rdquo; but he shrank dismayed under the slow blaze that lighted
      Plank's blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he stammered, struggling to his fat legs and instinctively
      backing away; &ldquo;I thought you meant business. I&mdash;what the devil do I
      care who you marry! It's the last time I try to do anything for you, or
      for anybody else! Mark that, my friend. I've plenty to worry over; I've a
      lot to keep me busy without lying awake to figure out how to do kindnesses
      to old friends. Damn this ingratitude, anyway!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank gazed at him for a moment; the anger in his face had died out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not ungrateful,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You may say almost anything except that,
      Leroy. I am not disloyal, no matter what else I may be. But you have made
      a bad mistake. You made it that day at Black Fells when you offered to
      interfere. I supposed you understood then that I could never tolerate from
      anybody anything of such a nature. It appears that you didn't. However,
      you understand it now. So let us forget the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mortimer, keenly appreciative of the pleasures of being misunderstood,
      squeezed some moisture out of his distended eyes, and sat down, a martyr
      to his emotions. &ldquo;To think,&rdquo; he gulped, &ldquo;that you, of all men, should turn
      on me like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean to. Can't you understand, Leroy, that you hurt me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurt hell!&rdquo; retorted Mortimer vindictively. &ldquo;You've had sensation
      battered out of you by this time. I guess society has landed you a few
      while I was boosting you over the outworks. Don't play that old con game
      on me! You tried to get her and you couldn't. Now I come along and offer
      to put you next and you yell about your hurt feelings! Oh, splash! There's
      another lady, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it go at that, then,&rdquo; said Plank, reddening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop it!&rdquo; snapped Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well! if you're going to take it that way again&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am. Cut it! And now let me ask you a question: Where were you going
      when I met you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to know for?&rdquo; asked Mortimer sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I'll tell you, Leroy. If you have any idea of identifying yourself
      with Quarrier's people, of seeking him at this juncture with the
      expectation of investing any money in his schemes, you had better not do
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Investing!&rdquo; sneered Mortimer. &ldquo;Well, no, not exactly, having nothing to
      invest, thanks to my being swindled into joining his Amalgamated Electric
      gang. Don't worry. If there's any shaking down to be done, I'll do it, my
      friend,&rdquo; and he rose, and started toward the elevators.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Plank. &ldquo;Why, man, you can't frighten Quarrier! What did you
      sell your holdings for? Why didn't you come to us&mdash;to me? What's the
      use of going to Quarrier now, and scolding? You can't scare a man like
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer fairly grinned in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your big mistake,&rdquo; he sneered, &ldquo;is in undervaluing others. You don't
      think I amount to very much, do you, Beverly? But I'm going to try to take
      care of myself all the same.&rdquo; He laughed, showing his big teeth, and the
      vanity in him began to drug him. &ldquo;No, you think I don't know much. But men
      like you and Quarrier will damn soon find out! I want you to understand,&rdquo;
       he went on excitedly, forgetting the instinctive caution which in saner
      moments he was only too certain that his present business required&mdash;&ldquo;I
      want you to understand a few things, my friend, and one of them is that
      I'm not afraid of Quarrier, and another is, I'm not afraid of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leroy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not afraid of you, either!&rdquo; repeated Mortimer with an ugly stare.
      &ldquo;Don't try any of your smug, aint-it-a-shame-he-drinks ways on me,
      Beverly! I'm getting tired of it; I'm tired of it now, by God! You keep a
      civil tongue in your head after this&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;and
      we'll get on all right. If you don't, I've the means to make you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you crazy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it! Too damn sane for you and Leila to hoodwink!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are crazy!&rdquo; repeated Plank, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I? You and Leila can take the matter into court, if you want to&mdash;unless
      I do. And&rdquo;&mdash;here he leaned forward, showing his teeth again&mdash;&ldquo;the
      next time you kiss her, close the door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went away up the marble steps and entered an elevator; and Plank,
      grave and pale, went out into the street and entered his big touring-car.
      But the drive up town and through the sunlit park gave him no pleasure,
      and he entered his great house with a heavy, lifeless step, head bent, as
      though counting every crevice in the stones under his lagging feet. For
      the first time in all his life he was afraid of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man he was afraid of had gone directly to Quarrier's office, missing
      the gentleman he was seeking by such a small fraction of a minute that he
      realised they must have passed each other in the elevators, he ascending
      while Quarrier was descending.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer turned and hurried to the elevator, hoping to come up with
      Quarrier in the rotunda, or possibly in the street outside; but he was too
      late, and, furious to think of the time he had wasted with Plank, he
      crawled into a hansom and bade the driver take him to a number he gave,
      designating one of the new limestone basement houses on the upper west
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way up town, as he jolted about in his seat, he angrily regretted
      the meeting with Plank, even in spite of the cheque. What demon had
      possessed him to boast&mdash;to display his hand when there had been no
      necessity? Plank was still ready to give him aid at a crisis&mdash;had
      always been ready. Time enough when Plank turned stingy to use persuasion;
      time enough when Plank attempted to dodge him to employ a club. And now,
      for no earthly reason, intoxicated with his own vanity, catering to his
      own long-smouldering resentment, he had used his club on a willing horse&mdash;deliberately
      threatened a man whose gratitude had been good for many a cheque yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ass that I am!&rdquo; fumed Mortimer; &ldquo;now when I'm stuck I'll have to go at
      him with the club, if I want any money out of him. Confound him, he's
      putting me in a false position! He's trying to make it look like
      extortion! I won't do it! I'm no blackmailer! I'll starve, before I go to
      him again! No blundering, clumsy Dutchman can make a blackmailer out of me
      by holding hands with that scoundrelly wife of mine! That's the reason he
      did it, too! Between them they are trying to make my loans from Plank look
      like blackmail! It would serve them right if I took them up&mdash;if I
      called their bluff, and stuck Plank up in earnest! But I won't, to please
      them! I won't do any dirty thing like that, to humour them! Not much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lay back, rolling about in the jouncing cab, scowling at space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I'll shake down Quarrier, though! I'll make him
      pay for his treachery&mdash;scaring me out of Amalgamated! That will be
      restitution, not extortion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was the angrier because he had been for days screwing up his courage to
      the point of seeking Quarrier face to face. He had not wished to do it;
      the scene, and his own attitude in it, could only be repugnant to him,
      although he continually explained to himself that it was restitution, not
      extortion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But whatever it was, he didn't like to figure in it, and he had hung back
      as long as circumstances permitted. But his new lodgings and his new
      friends were expensive; and Plank, he supposed, was off somewhere fishing;
      so he hung on as long as it was possible; then, exasperated by necessity,
      started for Quarrier's office, only to miss him by a few seconds because
      he was fool enough to waste his temper and his opportunity in making an
      enemy out of a friend!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;what an ass I am!&rdquo; And he got out of his cab in front
      of a very new limestone basement house with red geraniums blooming on the
      window-sills, and let himself in with a latch-key.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of the house was attractive in a rather bright, new, clean
      fashion. There seemed to be a great deal of white wood-work about, a
      wilderness of slender white spindles supporting the dark, rich mahogany
      handrail of the stairway; elaborate white grilles between snowy,
      Corinthian pillars separating the hall from the drawing-room, where a pale
      gilt mirror over a white, colonial mantel reflected a glass chandelier and
      panelled walls hung with pale blue silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was new, very clean, very quiet; the maid, too, who appeared at the
      sound of the closing door and took his hat and gloves was as newly groomed
      as the floors and wood-work, and so noiseless as to be conspicuous in her
      swift, silent movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet there was something about it all&mdash;about the bluish silvery
      half-light, the spotless floors and walls, the abnormally noiseless maid
      in her flamboyant cap and apron&mdash;that arrested attention and fixed
      it. The soundless brightness of the house was as conspicuous as the
      contrast between the maid's black gown and her snow-white cuffs. There was
      nothing subdued about anything, although the long, silvery blue curtains
      were drawn over the lace window hangings; no shadows anywhere, no
      half-lights. The very stillness was gay with suspense, like a pretty
      woman's suppressed laughter glimmering in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And into this tinted light, framed in palest blue and white, waddled
      Mortimer, appropriate as a June-bug scrambling in a SÃ¨vres teacup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody here?&rdquo; he growled, leering into the drawing-room at a tiny grand
      piano cased in unvarnished Circassian walnut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nobody at home, sir,&rdquo; said the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Music lesson over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, at three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to ascend the stairway, breathing heavily, thud, thud over the
      deep velvet strip, his fat hand grasping the banister rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere on the second floor a small dog barked, and Mortimer traversed
      the ball and opened the door into a room hung with gold Spanish leather
      and pale green curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Tinto!&rdquo; he said affably as a tiny Japanese spaniel hurled herself
      at him, barking furiously, then began writhing and weaving herself about
      him, gurgling recognition and welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down heavily in a padded easy-chair. The spaniel sprang into his
      lap, wheezing, sniffling, goggling its protruding eyes. Mortimer liked the
      dog, but he didn't like what the owner of the dog said about the
      resemblance between his own and Tinto's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get down!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you're shedding black and white hairs all over me.&rdquo;
       But the dog didn't want to get down, and Mortimer's good nature permitted
      her to curl up on his fat knees and sleep that nervous, twitching sleep
      peculiar to overpampered toy canines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The southern sun was warm in the room; the windows open, but not a silken
      hanging stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently another maid entered, with an apple cut into thin wafers and a
      decanter of port; and Mortimer lay back in his chair, sopping his apple in
      the thick, crimson wine, and feeding morsels of the combination to himself
      and to Tinto at intervals until the apple was all gone and the decanter
      three-fourths empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very still in the room&mdash;so still, that Mortimer, opening his
      eyes at longer and longer intervals to peer at the door, finally opened
      them no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The droning gurgle that he made kept Tinto awake. When his lower jaw
      sagged, and he began to really show what snoring could be, Tinto, very
      nervous, got up and hopped down.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still daylight when Mortimer awoke, conscious of people about him.
      As he opened his eyes, a man laughed; several people seated by the windows
      joined in. Then, straightening up with an effort, something tumbled from
      his head to the floor and he started to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, look out, Leroy! Don't step on my hat!&rdquo; cried a girl's voice; and he
      sank back in his chair, gazing stupidly around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! you people!&rdquo; he said, amused; &ldquo;I guess I've been asleep. Oh, is
      that you Millbank? Whose hat was that&mdash;yours, Lydia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He yawned, laughed, turning his heavy eyes from one to another,
      recognising a couple of young girls at the window. He didn't want to get
      up; but there is, in the society he now adorned, a stringency of etiquette
      known as &ldquo;re-finement,&rdquo; and which, to ignore, is to become unpopular.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he got onto his massive legs and went over to shake hands with a
      gravity becoming the ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d'ye do, Miss Hutchinson? Thought you were at Asbury Park. How de do,
      Miss Del Garcia. Have you been out in Millbank's motor yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We broke down at McGowan's Pass,&rdquo; said Miss Del Garcia, laughing the
      laugh that had made her so attractive in &ldquo;A Word to the Wise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Muddy gasoline,&rdquo; nodded Millbank tersely&mdash;an iron-jawed,
      over-groomed man of forty, with a florid face shaved blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We passed Mr. Plank's big touring-car,&rdquo; observed Lydia Vyse, shifting
      Tinto to the couch and brushing the black and white hairs from her
      automobile coat. &ldquo;How much does a car like that cost, Leroy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About twenty-five thousand,&rdquo; he said gloomily. Then, looking up, &ldquo;Hold
      on, Millbank, don't be going! Why can't you all dine with us? Never mind
      your car; ours is all right, and we'll run out into the country for
      dinner. How about it, Miss Del Garcia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But both Miss Del Garcia and Miss Hutchinson had accepted another
      invitation, in which Millbank was also included.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood about, veils floating, leather decorated coats thrown back,
      lingering for awhile to talk the garage talk which fascinates people of
      their type; then Millbank looked at the clock, made his adieux to Lydia,
      nodded significantly to Mortimer, and followed the others down-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something amiss with his motor, for it made a startling racket
      in the street, finally plunging forward with a kick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia laughed as the two young girls in the tonneau turned to nod to her
      in mock despair; then she came running back up-stairs, holding her skirt
      free from her hurrying little feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she inquired, as Mortimer turned back from the window to confront
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing doing, little girl,&rdquo; he said with a sombre smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, slowly divesting herself of her light leather-trimmed
      coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I missed him,&rdquo; said Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung the coat over a chair, stood a moment, her fingers busy with her
      hair-pegs, then sat down on the couch, taking Tinto into her lap. She was
      very pretty, dark, slim, marvellously graceful in her every movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I missed him,&rdquo; repeated Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you see him to-morrow?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Mortimer slowly. &ldquo;Oh, Lord! how I hate this
      business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn't he misused your confidence? Hasn't he taken your money?&rdquo; she
      asked. &ldquo;It may be unpleasant for you to make him unbelt, but you're a
      coward if you don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy! easy, now!&rdquo; muttered Mortimer; &ldquo;I'm going to shake it out of him. I
      said I would, and I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope so; it's yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly it's mine. I wish I'd held fast now. I never supposed Plank
      would take hold. It was that drivelling old Belwether who scared me stiff!
      The minute I saw him scurrying to cover like a singed cat I was fool
      enough to climb the first tree. I've had my lesson, little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you'll give Howard his. Somebody ought to,&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then gathering up her hat and coat she went into her own apartments.
      Mortimer picked up a cheap magazine, looked over the portraits of the
      actresses, then, hunching up into a comfortable position, settled himself
      to read the theatrical comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, Lydia not appearing, and his own valet arriving to turn on the
      electricity, bring him his White Rock and Irish and the Evening Telegraph,
      he hoisted his legs into another chair and sprawled there luxuriously over
      his paper until it was time to dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half past eight they dined in a white and pink dining-room furnished
      in dull gray walnut, and served by a stealthy, white-haired, pink-skinned
      butler, chiefly remarkable because it seemed utterly impossible to get a
      glimpse of his eyes. Nobody could tell whether there was anything the
      matter with them or not&mdash;and whether they were only very deep set or
      were weak, like an albino's, or were slightly crossed, the guests of the
      house never knew. Lydia herself didn't know, and had given up trying to
      find out.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had planned to go for a spin in Mortimer's motor after dinner, but in
      view of the Quarrier fiasco neither was in the mood for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer, as usual, ate and drank heavily. He was a carnivorous man, and
      liked plenty of thick, fat, underdone meat. As for Lydia, her appetite was
      as erratic as her own impulses. Her table, always wastefully elaborate, no
      doubt furnished subsistence for all the relatives of her household below
      stairs, and left sufficient for any ambitious butler to make a decent
      profit on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Leroy,&rdquo; she observed, as they left the table and sauntered
      back into the pale blue drawing-room, &ldquo;do you know that the servants
      haven't been paid for three months?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for Heaven's sake,&rdquo; he expostulated, &ldquo;don't begin that sort of thing!
      I get enough of that at home; I get it every time I show my nose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only mentioned it,&rdquo; she said carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you all right. It isn't any pleasanter for me than for you. In
      fact, I'm sick of it; I'm dead tired of being up against it every day of
      my life. When a man has anything somebody gets it before he can sidestep.
      When a man's dead broke there's nobody in sight to touch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had an opportunity to make Howard pay you back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't I tell you I missed him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. You are going to do something, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the gold and green room above. Lydia began pacing the
      length of a beautiful Kermanshah rug&mdash;a pale, delicate marvel of rose
      and green on a ground of ivory&mdash;lovely, but doomed to fade sooner
      than the pretty woman who trod it with restless, silk-shod feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer had not responded to her last question. She said presently: &ldquo;You
      have never told me how you intend to make him pay you back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; inquired Mortimer, turning very red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that you haven't yet told me how you intend to make Howard return
      the money you lost through his juggling with your stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't exactly know myself,&rdquo; admitted Mortimer, still overflushed. &ldquo;I
      mean to put it to him squarely, as a debt of honour that he owes. I asked
      him whether to invest. Damn him! he never warned me not to. He is morally
      responsible. Any man who would sit there and nod monotonously like a
      mandarin, knowing all the while what he was doing to wreck the company,
      and let a friend put into a rotten concern all the cash he could scrape
      together, is a swindler!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; she said, studying the rose arabesques in the rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little click of her teeth when she ended her inspection and
      looked across at Mortimer. Something in her expressionless gaze seemed to
      reassure him, and give him a confidence he may have lacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want him to understand that I won't swallow that sort of contemptible
      treatment,&rdquo; asserted Mortimer, lighting a thick, dark cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you'll make him understand,&rdquo; she said, seating herself and resting
      her clasped, brilliantly ringed hands in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I will&mdash;never fear! He has abused my confidence abominably; he
      has practically swindled me, Lydia. Don't you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell him so, too,&rdquo; blustered Mortimer, shaking himself into an
      upright posture, and laying a pudgy, clinched fist on the table. &ldquo;I'm not
      afraid of him! He'll find that out, too. I know enough to stagger him. Not
      that I mean to use it. I'm not going to have him think that my demands on
      him for my own property resemble extortion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extortion?&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I don't want him to think I'm trying to intimidate him. I won't have
      him think I'm a grafter; but I've half a mind to shake that money out of
      him, in one way or another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struck the table and looked at her for further sign of approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not afraid of him,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I wish to God he were here, and I'd
      tell him so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said coolly: &ldquo;I was wishing that too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a while they sat silent, preoccupied, avoiding each other's direct
      gaze. When she rose he started, watching her in a dazed way as she walked
      to the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo; she asked quietly, turning to him, her hand on the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait. W-what are you going to do?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call him up. Shall I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dull throb of fright pulsed through him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you are not afraid of him, Leroy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said with an oath, &ldquo;I am not. Go ahead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She unhooked the receiver. After a second or two her low, even voice
      sounded. There came a pause. She rested one elbow on the walnut shelf, the
      receiver tight to her ear. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Quarrier, please.... Yes, Mr. Howard Quarrier.... No, no name. Say it
      is on business of immediate importance.... Very well, then; you may say
      that Miss Vyse insists on speaking to him.... Yes, I'll hold the wire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned, the receiver at her ear, and looked narrowly at Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't he speak to you?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to find out. Hush a moment!&rdquo; and in the same calm, almost
      childish voice: &ldquo;Oh, Howard, is that you? Yes, I know I promised not to do
      this, but that was before things happened!... Well, what am I to do when
      it is necessary to talk to you?... Yes, it is necessary!... I tell you it
      is necessary!... I am sorry it is not convenient for you to talk to me,
      but I really must ask you to listen!... No, I shall not write. I want to
      talk to you to-night&mdash;now! Yes, you may come here, if you care to!...
      I think you had better come, Howard.... Because I am liable to continue
      ringing your telephone until you are willing to listen.... No, there is
      nobody here. I am alone. What time?... Very well; I shall expect you.
      Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hung up the receiver and turned to Mortimer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's coming up at once. Did I say anything to scare him particularly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing's sure as preaching,&rdquo; said Mortimer; &ldquo;he's a coward, and I'm
      dammed glad of it,&rdquo; he added naively, relighting his cigar, which had gone
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he comes up in his motor he'll be here in a few minutes,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;Suppose you take your hat and go out. I don't want him to think what he
      will think if he walks into the room and finds you waiting. You have your
      key, Leroy. Walk down the block; and when you see him come in, give him
      five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice had become a little breathless, and her colour was high.
      Mortimer, too, seemed apprehensive. Things had suddenly begun to work
      themselves out too swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that's best?&rdquo; he faltered, looking about for his hat. &ldquo;Tell
      Merkle that nobody has been here, if Quarrier should ask him. Do you think
      we're doing it in the best way, Lydia? By God, it smells of a put-up job
      to me! But I guess it's all right. It's better for me to just happen in,
      isn't it? Don't forget to put Merkle wise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He descended the stairs hastily. Merkle, of the invisible eyes, held his
      hat and gloves and opened the door for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once on the dark street, his impulse was to flee&mdash;get out, get away
      from the whole business. A sullen shame was pumping the hot blood up into
      his neck and cheeks. He strove to find an inoffensive name for what he was
      proposing to do, but ugly terms, synonym after synonym, crowded in to
      characterise the impending procedure, and he walked on angrily, half
      frightened, looking back from moment to moment at the house he had just
      left.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the corner he halted, breathing spasmodically, for he had struck a
      smarter pace than he had been aware of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few people passed him. Once he caught a glimmer of a policeman's buttons
      along the park wall, and an unpleasant shiver passed over him. At the same
      moment an electric hansom flew noiselessly past him. He shrank back into
      the shadow of a porte-cochere. The hansom halted before the limestone
      basement house. A tall figure left it, stood a moment in the middle of the
      sidewalk, then walked quickly to the front door. It opened, and the man
      vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hansom still waited at the door. Mortimer, his hands shaking, looked
      at his watch by the light of the electric bulbs flanking the gateway under
      which he stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not much time in which to make up his mind, yet his fright was
      increasing to a pitch which began to enrage him with that coward's courage
      which it is impossible to reckon with.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had missed Quarrier once to-day when he had been keyed to the
      encounter. Was he going to miss him again through sheer terror? Besides,
      was not Quarrier a coward? Besides, was it not his own money? Had he not
      been vilely swindled by a pretended friend? Urging, lashing himself into a
      heavy, shuffling motion, he emerged from the porte-cochere and lurched off
      down the street. No time to think now, no time for second thought, for
      hesitation, for weakness. He had waited too long already. He had waited
      ten minutes, instead of five. Was Quarrier going to escape again? Was he
      going to get out of the house before&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fumbling with his latch-key, but with sense enough left to make no noise,
      he let himself in, passed silently through the reception-hall and up to
      the drawing-room floor, where for a second he stood listening. Then
      something of the perverted sportsman sent the blood quivering into his
      veins. He had him! He had run him down! The game was at bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      An inrush of exhilaration steadied him. He laid his hand on the banister
      and mounted, gloves and hat-brim crushed in the other hand. When he
      entered the room he pretended to see only Lydia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, little girl!&rdquo; he said, laughing, &ldquo;are you surprised to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment he caught sight of Quarrier, and the start he gave was
      genuine enough. Never had he seen in a man's visage such white
      concentration of anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quarrier!&rdquo; he stammered, for his acting was becoming real enough to
      supplant art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier had risen; his narrowing eyes moved from Mortimer to Lydia, then
      reverted to the man in the combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather unexpected, isn't it?&rdquo; said Mortimer, staring at Quarrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; returned Quarrier in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; sneered Mortimer. &ldquo;Did you expect to find me here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Did you expect to find me?&rdquo; asked the other, with emphasis
      unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Mortimer hoarsely. &ldquo;What the devil do you
      mean by asking me if I expected to find you here? If I had, I'd not have
      travelled down to your office to-day to see you; I'd have come here for
      you. Naturally people suppose that an engaged man is likely to give up
      this sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier, motionless, white to the lips, turned his eyes from one to the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't look very well, does it?&rdquo; asked Mortimer; and he stood there,
      smiling, danger written all over him. &ldquo;It's beginning rather early,&rdquo; he
      continued, with a sneer. &ldquo;Most engaged men with a conscience wait until
      they're married before they return to the gay and frivolous. But here you
      are, it seems, handsome, jolly, and irresistible as ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier looked at Lydia, and his lips moved: &ldquo;You asked me to come,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you offered to. I wished to talk to you over the wire, but &ldquo;&mdash;her
      lip curled, and she shrugged her shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;you seemed to be afraid
      of something or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't talk to you in my own house, with guests in the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Did I say anything your fashionable guests might take exception
      to? Am I likely to do anything of that kind?&mdash;you coward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier stood very still, then noiselessly turned and made one step
      toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; interposed Mortimer blandly. &ldquo;As long as I travelled down
      town to see you, and find you here so unexpectedly, I may as well take
      advantage of this opportunity to regulate a little matter. You don't mind
      our talking shop for a moment, Lydia? Thank you. It's just a little
      business matter between Mr. Quarrier and myself&mdash;a matter concerning
      a few shares of stock which I once held in one of his companies, bought at
      par, and tumbled to ten and&mdash;What is the fraction, Quarrier? I
      forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier thought deeply for a moment; then he raised his head, looking
      full at Mortimer, and under his silky beard an edge of teeth glimmered.
      &ldquo;Did you wish me to take back those shares at par?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly! I knew you would! I knew you'd see it in that way!&rdquo; cried
      Mortimer heartily. &ldquo;Confound it all, Quarrier, I've always said you were
      that sort of man&mdash;that you'd never let a friend in on the top floor,
      and kick him clear to the cellar! As a matter of fact, I sold out at ten
      and three-eighths. Wait! Here's a pencil. Lydia, give me that pad on your
      desk. Here you are, Quarrier. It's easy enough to figure out how much you
      owe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as Quarrier slowly began tracing figures on the pad, Mortimer rambled
      on, growing more demonstrative and boisterous every moment. &ldquo;It's white of
      you, Quarrier&mdash;I'll say that! Legally, of course, you could laugh at
      me; but I've always said your business conscience would never let you
      stand for this sort of thing. 'You can talk and talk,' I've told people,
      many a time, 'but you'll never convince me that Howard Quarrier hasn't a
      heart.' No, by jinks! they couldn't make me believe it. And here's my
      proof&mdash;here's my vindication! Lydia, would you mind hunting up that
      cheque-book I left here before dinn&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had made a mistake. The girl flushed. He choked up, and cast a startled
      glance at Quarrier. But Quarrier, if he heard, made no motion of
      understanding. Perhaps it had not been necessary to convince him of the
      conspiracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished his figures he reviewed them, tracing each total with
      his pencil's point; then quietly handed the pad to Mortimer who went over
      it, and nodded that it was correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia rose. Quarrier said, without looking at her: &ldquo;I have a blank cheque
      with me. May I use one of these pens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he had brought a cheque! Had he supposed that a cheque might be
      necessary when Lydia called him up? Was he prepared to meet any demand of
      hers, too, even before Mortimer appeared on the scene?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As long as you have a cheque with you, Howard,&rdquo; said Lydia quietly,
      &ldquo;suppose you simply add to Mr. Mortimer's amount what you had intended to
      offer me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her without answering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That little remembrance for old time's sake. Don't you recollect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Quarrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Howard! Didn't you promise me all sorts of things when I wanted to
      go to your friend Mr. Siward, and explain that it was not his fault I got
      into the Patroons Club? Don't you remember I felt dreadfully that he was
      expelled&mdash;that I was simply wild to write to the governors and tell
      them how I took Merkle's clothes and drove to the club and waited until I
      saw a lot of men go in, and then crowded in with the push?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer was staring at Quarrier out of his protruding eyes. The girl
      leaned forward, deliberate, self-possessed, the red lips edged with
      growing scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a dirty trick!&rdquo; said Mortimer heavily. He took the pad, added a
      figure, passed it to Lydia, and she coolly wrote a total, underscoring it
      heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the amount,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier looked at the pad which she had tossed upon the desk. Then he
      slowly wetted his pen with ink, and, laying the loose cheque flat, began
      to fill it in. Afterward he dried it, and, reading it carefully, pushed it
      aside and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn't be advisable for you to stop payment, you know,&rdquo; observed
      Mortimer insolently, lying back in his chair and stretching his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Quarrier, pausing to turn on them a deathly stare. Then he
      went away. After awhile they heard the door close. But there was no sound
      from the electric hansom, and Mortimer rose and walked to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia stood at the desk, examining the cheque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to afford a decent touring-car now,&rdquo; she suggested&mdash;&ldquo;like
      that yellow and black Serin-Chanteur car of Mr. Plank's.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIII THE SELLING PRICE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The heat, which had been severe in June, driving the last fashionable
      loiterer into the country, continued fiercely throughout July. August was
      stifling; the chestnut leaves in the parks curled up and grew brittle; the
      elms were blotched; brown stretches scarred the lawns; the blazing colour
      of the geranium beds seemed to intensify the heat, like a bed of living
      coals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody who was anybody remained in town&mdash;except some wealthy business
      men and their million odd employÃ©s; but the million, being nobodies,
      didn't count.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody came into town; that is to say that a million odd strangers came as
      usual, swelling the sweltering, resident population sufficiently to
      animate the main commercial thoroughfares morning and evening, but they
      didn't count; the money they spent was, however, very carefully counted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fashionable columns of the newspapers informed the fashionable
      ex-urbanated that the city was empty&mdash;though the East Side reeked
      like a cattle-pen, and another million or two gasped on the hot, tin roofs
      under the stars, or buried their dirty faces in the parched park grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the press meant to say was that the wealthy section of the city
      within the shadow of St. Patrick's twin white spires and north of
      Fifty-ninth Street was as empty and silent as an abandoned gold-mine.
      Which was true. Miles of elaborate, untenanted dwellings glimmered blank
      under the moon and stood tomb-like in barren magnificence against the
      blazing blue of noon. Miles of plate-glass windows, boarded, or bearing
      between lowered shade and dusty pane the significant parti-coloured
      placard warning the honest thief, stared out at the heated park or, in the
      cross streets, confronted each other with inert hauteur, awaiting the
      pleasure of their absent owners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The humidity increased; the horses' heads hung heavily under their
      ridiculously pitiful straw bonnets. When the sun was vertical nobody
      stirred; when the bluish shadows began to creep out over baked sidewalks,
      broadening to a strip of superheated shade, a few stirred abroad in the
      deserted streets; here a policeman, thin blue summer tunic open, helmet in
      hand, swabbing the sweat from forehead and neck; there a white uniformed
      street sweeper dragging his rubber-edged mop or a section of wet hose;
      perhaps a haggard peddler of lemonade making for the Park wall around the
      Metropolitan Museum where, a little later, the East Side would venture out
      to sit on the benches, or the great electric tourists' busses would halt
      to dump out a living cargo&mdash;perhaps only the bent figure of a woman,
      very shabby, very old, dragging her ancient bones along the silent
      splendour of Fifth Avenue, and peering about the gutters for something she
      never finds&mdash;always peering, always mumbling the endless, wordless,
      soundless miserere of the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier's huge limestone mansion, looming golden in the sun, was
      tenantless; its owner, closing even The Sedges, his Long Island house, and
      driven northward for a breath of air, was expected at Shotover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house of Mrs. Mortimer was closed and boarded up; the Caithness
      mansion was closed; the Ferralls', the Bonnesdels', the Pages', the
      Shannons', Mrs. Vendenning's, all were sealed up like vaults. A caretaker
      apparently guarded Major Belwether's house, peeping out at intervals from
      behind the basement windows. As for Plank's great pile of masonry, edging
      the outer Hundreds in the north, several lighted windows were to be seen
      in it at night, and a big yellow and black touring-car whizzed down town
      from its bronze gateway every morning with perfect regularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For there was a fight on that had steadily grown hotter with the weather,
      and Plank had little time to concern himself with the temperature or to
      mop his red features over the weather bureau report. Harrington and
      Quarrier were after him, horse, foot, and dragoons; Harrington had even
      taken a house at Seabright in order to be near in person; and Quarrier's
      move from Long Island to Shotover House was not as flippant as it might
      appear, for he had his private car there and a locomotive at Black Fells
      Crossing station, and he was within striking distance of Rochester, Utica,
      Syracuse, and Albany. Which was what Harrington thought necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast unseen machinery set in motion by Harrington and Quarrier had
      begun to grind in May; and, at the first audible rumble, the aspect of
      things financial in the country changed. A few industrials began to
      rocket, nobody knew why; but the market's first tremor left it baggy and
      spineless, and the reaction, already overdue, became a sodden and soggy
      slump. Nobody knew why.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise of the fray in the papers, which had first excited then stunned
      the outside public, continued in a delirium of rumour, report, forecast,
      and summing up at the week's end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scare heads, involving everybody and everything, from the
      District-Attorney to Plank's office boy, succeeded one another. Plank's
      name headed column after column. Already becoming familiar in the society
      and financial sections, it began to appear in neighbouring paragraphs. Who
      was Plank? And the papers told people with more or less inaccuracy,
      humour, or sarcasm. What was he trying to do? The papers tried to tell
      that, too, making a pretty close guess, with comments good-natured or
      ill-natured according to circumstances over which somebody ought to have
      some control. What was Harrington trying to do to Plank&mdash;if he was
      trying to do anything? They told that pretty clearly. What was Quarrier
      going to do to Plank? That, also, they explained in lively detail. A few
      clergymen who stuck to their churches began to volunteer pulpit opinions
      concerning the ethics of the battle. A minister who was generally supposed
      to make an unmitigated nuisance of himself in politics dealt Plank an
      unexpected blow by saying that he was a &ldquo;hero.&rdquo; Some papers called him
      &ldquo;Hero&rdquo; Plank for awhile, but soon tired of it or forgot it under the
      stress of the increasing heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides Plank scarcely noticed what the press said of him. He was too
      busy; his days were full days, brimming over deep into the night. Brokers,
      lawyers, sycophants, tipsters, treacherous ex-employÃ©s of Quarrier,
      detectives, up-State petty officials, lobbyists from Albany, newspaper
      men, men from Wall Street, Broad Street, Mulberry Street, Forty-second
      Street&mdash;all these he saw in units, relays, regiments&mdash;either at
      his offices or after dinner&mdash;and sometimes after midnight in his own
      house. And these were only a few, picked from the interested or
      disinterested thousands who besieged him with advice, importunity,
      threats, and attempted blackmail. And he handled them all in turn,
      stolidly but with decision. His obstinate under lip protruded further and
      further with rare recessions; his heavy head was like the lowered head of
      a bull. Undaunted, inexorable, slow to the verge of stupidity at times, at
      times swift as a startled tiger, this new, amazing personality steadily
      developing, looming higher, heavier, athwart the financial horizon&mdash;in
      stature holding his own among giants, then growing, gradually, inch by
      inch, dominated his surrounding level sky line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth in him was the tragedy to the old; the sudden silence of the man
      the danger to the secretive. Harrington was already an old man; Quarrier's
      own weapon had always been secrecy; but the silence of Plank confused him,
      for he had never learned to parry well another's use of his own weapon.
      The left-handed swordsman dreads to cross with a man who fights with the
      left hand. And Harrington, hoary, seamed, scarred, maimed in onslaughts of
      long forgotten battles, looked long and hard upon this weird of his own
      dead youth which now rose towering to confront him, menacing him with the
      armed point of the same shield behind which he himself had so long found
      shelter&mdash;the Law!
    </p>
    <p>
      The closing of the courts enforced armed truces along certain lines of
      Plank's battle front; the adjournment of the legislature emptied Albany.
      Once it was rumoured that Plank had passed an entire morning with the
      Governor of the greatest State in the Union and that the conference was to
      be repeated. A swarm of newspaper men settled about the Governor's summer
      cottage at Saratoga, but they learned nothing, nor could they find a trace
      of Plank's tracks in the trodden trails of the great Spa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, the racing had begun; Desmond, Burbank, Sneed, and others of the
      gilded guild had opened new club-houses; the wretched, half-starved
      natives in the surrounding hills were violating the game-laws to distend
      the paunches of the overfed with five-inch troutlings and grouse and
      woodcock slaughtered out of season; so there was plenty of copy for
      newspaper men without the daily speculative paragraph devoted to the
      doings of Beverly Plank. Some scandal, too&mdash;but newspapers never
      touch that; and after all it was nobody's affair that Leroy Mortimer drove
      a large yellow and black Serin-Chanteur touring-car, new model, all over
      Saratoga county. Perhaps the similarity of machines gave rise to the
      rumour of Plank's presence; perhaps not, because the car was often driven
      by a tall, slender girl with dark eyes and hair; and nobody ever saw that
      sort of pretty woman in Plank's Serin, or saw Leroy Mortimer for many days
      without a companion of that species.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer's health was excellent. The races had not proved remunerative
      however, and his new motor-car was horribly expensive. So was Lydia. And
      he began to be seriously afraid that by the end of August he would be
      obliged to apply to Quarrier once more for some slight temporary token of
      that gentleman's goodwill. He told Lydia this, and she seemed to agree
      with him. This pleased him. She had not pleased him very much recently.
      For one thing she was becoming too friendly with some of his friends&mdash;Desmond
      in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank, it was known, had opened his great house at Black Fells. His
      servants, gamekeepers, were there; his stables, kennels, greenhouses,
      model stock-farm&mdash;all had been put in immaculate condition pending
      the advent of the master. But Plank had not appeared; his new sea-going
      steam yacht still lay in the East River, and, at rare intervals, a
      significant glimmer of bunting disclosed the owner's presence aboard for
      an hour or two. That was all, however; and the cliff-watchers at Shotover
      House and the Fells looked seaward in vain for the big Siwanoa, as yacht
      after yacht, heralded by the smudge on the horizon, turned from a gray
      speck to a white one, and crept in from the sea to anchor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ferralls were at Shotover with their first instalment of guests.
      Sylvia was there, Quarrier expected&mdash;because Kemp Ferrall's break
      with him was not a social one, and Grace's real affection for Sylvia
      blinded neither her nor her husband to the material and social importance
      of the intimacy. Siward was not invited; neither had an invitation to him
      been even discussed in view of what Grace was aware of, and what everybody
      knew concerning the implacable relations existing between him, personally,
      and Howard Quarrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge, yachting, and motoring were the August sports; the shooting set
      had not yet arrived, of course; in fact there was still another relay
      expected before the season opened and brought the shooting coterie for the
      first two weeks. But Sylvia was expected to last through and hold over
      with a brief interlude for a week's end at Lenox. So was Quarrier; and
      Grace, always animated by a lively but harmless malice, hoped to Heaven
      that Plank might arrive before Quarrier left, because she adored the
      tension of situations and was delightedly persuaded that Plank was more
      than able to hold his own with her irritating cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to see them together in a small room,&rdquo; she sighed ecstatically in
      Sylvia's ear; &ldquo;I'd certainly poke them up if they only turned around
      sulkily in the corners of the cage and evinced a desire to lie down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a mischief-maker you are,&rdquo; said Sylvia listlessly; and though Grace
      became very vivacious in describing her plans to extract amusement out of
      Plank's hoped-for presence Sylvia remained uninterested.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed, in fact, little to interest her that summer at Shotover
      House; and, though she never refused any plans made for her, and her
      attitude was one of quiet acquiescence always&mdash;she never expressed a
      preference for anything, a desire to do anything; and, if let alone, was
      prone to pace the cliffs or stretch her slim, rounded body on the sand of
      some little, sheltered, crescent beach, apparently content with the
      thunderous calm of sea and sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her interest, too, in people had seemingly been extinguished. Once or
      twice she did inquire as to Marion's whereabouts, and learned that Miss
      Page was fishing in Minnesota somewhere but would return to Shotover when
      the shooting opened. Somebody, Captain Voucher, perhaps, mentioned to
      somebody in her hearing that Siward was still in New York. If she heard
      she made no sign, no inquiry. The next morning she remained abed with a
      headache, and Grace motored to Wendover without her; but Sylvia spent the
      balance of the day on the cliffs, and played Bridge with the devil's own
      luck till dawn, piling up a score that staggered Mr. Fleetwood, who had
      been instructing her in adversary play a day or two before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hot month dragged on; Quarrier came; Agatha Caithness arrived a few
      days later&mdash;scheme of the Ferralls involving Alderdene!&mdash;but the
      Siwanoa did not come, and Plank remained invisible. Leila Mortimer arrived
      from Swan's Harbour toward the middle of the month, offering no
      information as to the whereabouts of what Major Belwether delicately
      designated as her &ldquo;legitimate.&rdquo; But everybody knew he was at last to be
      crossed off and struck clean out, and the ugly history of the winter, now
      so impudently corroborated at Saratoga, gave many a hostess the
      opportunity long desired. Mortimer, as far as his own particular circle
      was concerned, was down and out; Leila, accepted as a matter of course
      without him, remained quietly uncommunicative. If the outward physical
      change in her was due to her marital rupture people thought it was well
      that it had come in time, for she bloomed like a lovely exotic; and her
      silences and enthusiasms, and the fragrant freshness of her developing
      attitude toward the world first disconcerted, then amused, then touched
      those who had supposed themselves to be so long a buckler for her foibles
      and a shield for her caprice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad,&rdquo; said Alderdene, &ldquo;she's well rid of him if he's been choking her
      this long&mdash;the rank, rotten weed that he is, sapping the life from
      her so when she hung over toward another fellow's bush we thought she was
      frail in the stem&mdash;God bless us all for a simpering lot of
      blatherskites!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And if, in the corner of the gun-room, there was a man among them who had
      ever ventured to hold Leila's smooth little hand, unrebuked, in days gone
      by, none the less he knew that Alderdene spoke truth; and none the less he
      knew that what witness he might be called to bear at the end of the end of
      all must only incriminate himself and not that young matron who now,
      before their very eyes, was budding again, reverting to the esoteric charm
      of youth reincarnated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A suit before a referee would settle him,&rdquo; mused Voucher; &ldquo;he hasn't a
      leg to stand on. Lord! The same cat that tripped up Stephen Siward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fleetwood's quick eyes glimmered for an instant in Quarrier's direction.
      Quarrier was in the billiard-room, out of earshot, practising balk-line
      problems with Major Belwether; and Fleetwood said: &ldquo;The same cat that
      tripped up Stephen Siward. Yes. But who let her loose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was your dinner; you ought to know,&rdquo; said Voucher bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do know. He brought her&rdquo;&mdash;nodding toward the billiard-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belwether?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; yawned Fleetwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody said presently: &ldquo;Isn't he one of the Governors? Oh, I say, that
      was rather rough on Siward though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, rough. The law of trespass ought to have operated; a man's liable
      for the damage done by his own live-stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a brutal way of talking,&rdquo; said somebody. And the subject was
      closed with the entrance of Agatha in white flannels on her way to the
      squash court where she had an appointment with Quarrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A strange girl,&rdquo; said somebody after she had disappeared with Quarrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That pallor is stunning,&rdquo; said a big, ruddy youth, with sunburn on his
      neck and forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't healthy,&rdquo; said Fleetwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It attracts me,&rdquo; persisted the ruddy young man, voicing naively that
      curious truth concerning the attraction that disease so often exerts on
      health&mdash;the strange curiosity the normal has for the sub-normal&mdash;that
      fascination of the wholesome for the unhealthy. It is, perhaps, more
      curiosity than anything, unless, deep hidden under the normal, there lie
      one single, perverted nerve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia, passing the hall, glanced in through the gun-room door with an
      absentminded smile at the men and their laughing greeting, as they rose
      with uplifted glasses to salute her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sweetest of all,&rdquo; observed a man, disconsolately emptying his glass.
      &ldquo;Oh irony! What a marriage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know any girl who would not change places with her?&rdquo; asked
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every man there insisted that he knew one girl at least who would not
      exchange Sylvia's future for her own. That was very nice of them; it is to
      be hoped they believed it. Some of them did&mdash;for the moment, anyhow.
      Then Alderdene, blinking furiously, emitted one of his ear-racking laughs;
      and everybody, as usual, laughed too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You damned cynic,&rdquo; observed Voucher affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody,&rdquo; said Fleetwood, &ldquo;insists that she doubled up poor Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never met Siward until she was engaged to Howard,&rdquo; remarked Voucher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't you consider that enough to squelch the story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Engaged girls,&rdquo; mused Alderdene, &ldquo;never double up except at Bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody has been or is in love with Sylvia Landis,&rdquo; said Voucher, &ldquo;and
      it's a man's own fault if he's hit. Once she did it, innocently enough,
      and enjoyed it, never realising that it hurt a man to be doubled up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fleetwood yawned again and said: &ldquo;She can have me to-morrow. But she
      won't. She's tired of the sport. Any girl would get enough with the pack
      at her heels day in and day out. Besides she's done for&mdash;unless she
      looses Quarrier and starts on a duke-hunt over in Blinky's country!... Is
      anybody on for a sail? Is anybody on for anything? No? Oh, very well.
      Shove that decanter north by west, Billy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was characteristic of the dog-days at Shotover. The dog-days in town
      were very different; the city threw open the parks to the poor at night;
      horses fell dead in the streets; pallid urchins, stripped naked, splashed
      and rolled and screeched in the basin of the City Hall fountain under the
      indifferent eyes of the police.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Plank he was too busy to know what the thermometer was about; he
      had no time for anything outside of his own particular business except to
      go every day to the big, darkened house in lower Fifth Avenue where the
      days had been hard on Siward and the nights harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Siward, however, could walk now, using his crutches still, but often
      stopping to gently test his left foot and see how much weight he was able
      to bear on it&mdash;even taking a tentative step or two without crutch
      support. He drove when he thought it prudent to use the horses in the
      heat, usually very early in the morning, though sometimes at night with
      Plank when the latter had time to run his touring-car through the park and
      out into the Bronx or Westchester for a breath of air.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Plank wanted him to go away, get out of the city for his
      convalescence, and Siward flatly declined, demanding that Plank permit him
      to do his share in the fight against the Inter-County people.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Plank, utterly unable to persuade him, and the more hampered because
      of his anxiety about Siward&mdash;though that young man did not know it&mdash;wore
      himself out providing Siward with such employment in the matter as would
      lightly occupy him without doing any good to the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Siward, stripped to his pajamas, pored over reams of typewritten matter
      and took his brief walking exercise in the comparative cool of the evening
      and drove when he dared use his horses; or, sitting beside Plank, whizzed
      northward through the starry darkness of the suburbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was that he first began to like Plank very much he could not
      exactly remember. He was not, perhaps, aware of how much he liked him.
      Plank's unexpected fits of shyness, of formality, often and often amused
      him. But there was a subtler feeling under the unexpressed amusement, and,
      beneath all, a constantly increasing sub-stratum of respect. Too, he found
      himself curiously at ease with Plank, as with one born to his own caste.
      And this feeling, unconscious, but more and more apparent, meant more to
      Plank than anything that had ever happened to him. It was a tonic in hours
      of doubt, a pleasure in his brief leisure, a pride never to be hinted at,
      never to be guessed, never to be dreamed of by any living soul save Plank
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, one sultry day toward the last week in August, a certain judge of a
      certain court, known among some as &ldquo;Harrington's judge,&rdquo; sent secretly for
      Plank. And Plank knew that the crisis was over. But neither Harrington nor
      Quarrier dreamed of such a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fear sat heavy on that judge's soul&mdash;the godless, selfish fear that
      sends the first coward slinking from the councils of conspiracy to seek
      immunity from those slowly grinding millstones that grind exceeding fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier at Shotover, with his private car and his locomotive within an
      hour's drive, strolled with Sylvia on the eve of her departure for Lenox
      with Leila Mortimer; then, when their conference was ended, he returned to
      Agatha, calmly unconscious of impending events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harrington, at Seabright, paced his veranda, awaiting this same judge,
      annoyed as two boats came in without the expected guest. And never for one
      instant did he dream that his creature sat closeted with Plank, tremulous,
      sallow, nearing the edge of cringing avowal&mdash;only held back from
      utter collapse by the agonising necessity of completing a bargain that
      might save himself from the degradation of the punishment that had seemed
      inevitable. All day long he sat with Plank. Nobody except those two knew
      he was there. And after a very long time Plank consented that nobody else
      except Siward and Harrington and Quarrier should ever know. So he called
      up Harrington on the telephone, saying that there was, in the office,
      somebody who desired to speak to him. And when Harrington caught the
      judge's first faint, stammered word he reeled where he stood, ashen,
      unbelieving, speechless. The shaking but remorseless voice went on,
      dinning horribly in his ear, then ceased, and Plank's heavy voice sounded
      the curt coup de grÃ¢ce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harrington was an old man, a very old man, mortally hurt; but he steadied
      himself along the wall of his study to the desk and sank into the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he sat, feeling the scars of old wounds throbbing, feeling his age
      and the tragedy of it, and the new sensation of fear&mdash;fear of the
      wraith of his own youth, wearing the mask of Plank, and menacing him with
      the menace he had used on others so long ago&mdash;so very long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little while he passed a thin hand over his eyes, over his gray
      head, over the mouth that all men watched with fear, over the shaven jaw
      now grimly set, but trembling. His hand, too, shook with palsy as he
      wrote, painfully picking out the words and figures of the cipher from his
      code-book; but he closed his thin lips and squared his unsteady jaw and
      wrote his message to Quarrier:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all up. Plank will take over Inter-County. Come at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that was all there was to be done until he could come into Plank's
      camp with arms and banners, a conquered man, cynical of the mercy he dared
      not expect and which, in all his life, he had never, never shown to man,
      to woman, or to child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank slept the sleep of utter exhaustion that night; the morning found
      him haggard but strong, cool in his triumph, serious, stern faced, almost
      sad that his work was done, the battle won.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his own house he telegraphed a curt summons to Harrington and to
      Quarrier for a conference in his own office; then, finishing whatever
      business his morning mail required, put on his hat and went to see the one
      man in the world he was most glad for.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found him at breakfast, sipping coffee and wrinkling his brows over the
      eternal typewritten pages. And Plank's face cleared at the sight and he
      sat down, laughing aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all over, Siward,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Harrington knows it; Quarrier knows it
      by this time. Their judge crawled in yesterday and threw himself on our
      mercy; and the men whose whip he obeyed will be on their way to surrender
      by this time.... Well! Haven't you a word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many,&rdquo; said Siward slowly; &ldquo;too many to utter, but not enough to express
      what I feel. If you will take two on account, here they are in one phrase:
      thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Debt's cancelled,&rdquo; said Plank, laughing. &ldquo;Do you want to hear the
      details?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They talked for an hour, and, in the telling, even Plank's stolidity gave
      way sufficient to make his heavy voice ring at moments, and the glimmer of
      excitement edge his eyes. Yet, in the telling, he scarcely mentioned
      himself, never hinted of the personal part&mdash;the inspiration which was
      his alone; the brunt of the battle which centred in him; the tireless
      vigilance; the loneliness of the nights when he lay awake, perplexed with
      doubt and nobody to counsel him&mdash;because men who wage such wars are
      lonely men and must work out their own salvation. No, nobody but his peers
      could advise him; and he had thought that his enemy was his peer, until
      that enemy surrendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrative exchanged by Plank in return for Siward's intensely
      interested questions was a simple, limpid review of a short but terrific
      campaign that only yesterday had threatened to rage through court after
      court, year after year. In the sudden shock of the cessation from battle,
      Plank himself was a little dazed. Yet he himself had expected the treason
      that ended all; he himself had foreseen it. He had counted on it as a good
      general counts on such things, confidently, but with a dozen plans as
      substitutes in case that plan failed&mdash;each plan as elaborately worked
      out to the last detail as though it alone existed as the only hope of
      victory. But if Siward suspected something of this it was not from Plank
      that he learned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plank,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;there is nothing in the world that men admire
      more than a man. It is a good deal of a privilege for me to tell you so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank turned red with surprise and embarrassment, stammering out something
      incoherent.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all that was said about the victory. Siward, unusually gay for
      awhile, presently turned sombre; and it was Plank's turn to lift him out
      of it by careless remarks about his rapid convalescence, and the chance
      for vacation he so much needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once Siward looked up vacantly: &ldquo;Where am I to go?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I'd as soon
      stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm going,&rdquo; insisted Plank. &ldquo;The Fells is all ready for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Fells! I can't go there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-what?&rdquo; faltered Plank, looking at Siward with hurt eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you&mdash;don't you understand?&rdquo; said Siward in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You once promised&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plank, I'll go anywhere except there with you. I'd rather be with you
      than with anybody. Can I say more than that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you ought to, Siward. A&mdash;a fellow feels the refusal of his
      offered roof-tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man! man! it isn't your roof I am refusing. I want to go; I'd give
      anything to go. If it were anywhere except where it is, I'd go fast
      enough. Now do you understand? If&mdash;if Shotover House and Shotover
      people were not next door to the Fells, I'd go. Now do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank said: &ldquo;I don't know whether I understand. If you mean Quarrier, he's
      on his way here, and he'll have business to keep him here for the next few
      months, I assure you. But&rdquo;&mdash;he looked very gravely across at Siward&mdash;&ldquo;if
      you don't mean Quarrier&mdash;&rdquo; He hesitated, ill at ease under the
      expressionless scrutiny of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what's the matter with me, Plank?&rdquo; he asked at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have wondered. I wonder now how much you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little, Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank looked up, hesitated, and shook his head: &ldquo;One infers from what one
      hears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Infers what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth, I suppose,&rdquo; replied Plank simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what,&rdquo; insisted Siward, &ldquo;have you inferred that you believe to be the
      truth? Don't parry, Plank; it isn't easy for me, and I&mdash;I never
      before spoke this way to any man.... It is likely I should have spoken to
      my mother about it.... I had expected to. It may be weakness&mdash;I don't
      know; but I'd like to talk a little about it to somebody. And there's
      nobody fit to listen, except you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you feel that way,&rdquo; said Plank slowly, &ldquo;I will be very glad to
      listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel that way. I've been through&mdash;some things; I've been pretty
      sick, Plank. It tires a man out; a man's head and shoulders get tired. Oh,
      I don't mean the usual reaction from self-contempt, disgust&mdash;the
      dreadful, aching sadness of it all which lasts even while desire, stunned
      for the moment, wakens into craving. I don't mean that. It is something
      else&mdash;a deathly, mental solitude that terrifies. I tell you, no man
      except a man smitten by my malady knows what solitude can be!... There! I
      didn't mean to be theatrical; I had no intention of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; cut in Plank heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!... Yes, I want to. You know what a pillow is to a tired man's
      shoulders. I want to use your sane intelligence to rest on a moment. It's
      my brain that's tired, Plank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although everybody had cynically used Plank, nobody had ever before found
      him a necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said unsteadily. &ldquo;If I can be of use to you, Siward, in God's
      name let me be, for I have never been necessary to anybody in all my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward rested his head on one clinched hand: &ldquo;How much chance do you think
      I have?&rdquo; he asked wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chance to get well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank considered for a moment, then: &ldquo;You are not trying, Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been trying since&mdash;since March.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since March?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank looked at him curiously: &ldquo;What happened in March?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I better tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know better than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward, cheek crushed against his fist, his elbow on the desk, gazed at
      him steadily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In March,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Miss Landis spoke to me. I've made a better fight
      since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank's serious face darkened. &ldquo;Is she the only anchor you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plank, I am not even sure of her. I have made a better fight since then;
      that is all I dare say. I know what men think about a man like me; I knew
      they demand character, pride, self-denial. But, Plank, I am driving faster
      and faster toward the breakers, and these anchors are dragging. For it is
      not, in my case, the physical failure to obey the will; it is the will
      itself that has been attacked from the first. That is the horror of it.
      And what is there behind the will-power to strengthen it? Only the source
      of will-power&mdash;the mind. It is the mind that cannot help me. What am
      I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a spiritual strength,&rdquo; said Plank timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never dreamed of denying it,&rdquo; said Siward. &ldquo;I have tried to find
      it through the accepted sources&mdash;accepted by me, too. God has not
      helped me in the conventional way or through traditional methods; but that
      has not inclined me to doubt Him as the tribunal of last resort,&rdquo; he added
      hastily. &ldquo;I don't for a moment waver in faith because I am ignorant of the
      proper manner to approach Him. The Arbiter of all knows that I desire to
      be decent. He must be aware, too, that all anchors save one have failed to
      hold me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;Miss Landis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It may be weakness; it may be to my shame that the cables of pride
      and self-respect, even the spiritual respect for the Highest, cannot hold
      me when this one anchor holds. All I know is that it holds&mdash;so far.
      It held me at Shotover; it holds me again, now. And the rocks were close
      abeam, Plank&mdash;very close&mdash;when she spoke to me over the wires,
      through the rain, that dark day in March.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moistened his lips feverishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said that I might see her. I have waited a long time. I have taken my
      fighting chance again and I've won out, so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at Plank, curiously embarrassed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your body is normal; your intelligence wholesome, balanced, sane; and I
      want to ask you if you think that perhaps, without understanding how, I
      have found in her, or through her, in some way, the spiritual source that
      I think might help me to help myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, as Plank made no reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or am I talking sentimental cant? Don't answer, if you think that. I
      can't trust my own mind any more, anyway; and,&rdquo; with an ugly laugh, &ldquo;I'll
      know it all some day&mdash;the sooner the better!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't say that!&rdquo; growled Plank. &ldquo;You were sane a moment ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward looked up sharply, but the other silenced him with a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! You asked me a perfectly sane question&mdash;so wholesome, so
      normal, that I'm trying to frame an answer worthy of it! I intimated that
      after the physical, the mental, the ethical phenomena, there remained
      always the spiritual instinct. Like a wireless current, if a man can
      establish communication it is well for him, whatever the method. You
      assented, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you ask me if I believe it possible that she can be the medium?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank said deliberately: &ldquo;Yes, I do think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The silence was again broken by Plank: &ldquo;Siward, you have asked me what I
      think. Now you must listen to the end. If you believed that through her&mdash;her
      love, marrying her&mdash;you stood the best chance in the world to win
      out, it would be cowardly to ask her to take the risk. As much as I care
      for you I had rather see you lose the fight than accept such a risk from
      her. Now you know what I think&mdash;but you don't know all. Siward, I say
      to you that if you are man enough to take her, take her! And I say that of
      the two risks she is running to-day, the chance she might take with you is
      infinitely the lesser risk. For with you, if you continue slowly losing
      your fight, the mental suffering only will be hers. But if she closes this
      bargain with Quarrier, selling to him her body, the light will go out of
      her soul for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned heavily toward Siward, stretching out his powerful arm:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You marry her; and keep open your spiritual communication through her, if
      that is the way it has been established, and hang on to your God that way
      until your body is dead! I tell you, Siward, to marry her. I don't care
      how you do it; I don't care how you get her. Take her! Yours, of the two,
      is the stronger character, or she would not be where she is. Does she want
      what you cannot give her? Cure that desire&mdash;it is more contemptible
      than the craving that shatters you! I say, let the one-eyed lead the
      blind. Miracles are worked out by mathematics&mdash;if you have faith
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose, striding the length of the room once or twice, turned, holding
      out his broad hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Harrington is about due at my office; Quarrier will
      probably turn up to-night. I am not vindictive; I shall be just with them&mdash;as
      just as I know how, which is to be as merciful as I dare be. Good-bye,
      Siward. I&mdash;I believe you and she are going to get well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone, Siward lay back in his chair, very still, eyes closed. A
      faint colour had mounted to his face and remained there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the afternoon when he went down-stairs, using his crutches
      lightly. Gumble handed him a straw hat and opened the door, and Siward
      cautiously descended the stoop, stood for a few moments on the sidewalk,
      looking up at the blue sky, then wheeled and slowly made his way toward
      Washington Square. The avenue was deserted; his own house appeared to be
      the only remaining house still open in all that old-fashioned but
      respectable quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swung leisurely southward, a slim, well-built young fellow, strangely
      out of place on crutches. The poor always looked at him; beggars never
      importuned him, yet found him agreeable to watch. Children, who seldom
      look up into the air far enough to notice grown people, always became
      conscious of him when he passed; often smiled, sometimes spoke. As for
      stray curs and tramp cats, they were for ever making advances. As long as
      he could remember, there was scarcely a week in town but some homeless dog
      attached himself to Siward's heels, sometimes trotting several blocks,
      sometimes following him home&mdash;where the outcast was always cared for,
      washed, fed, and ultimately shipped out to the farm, where scores of these
      &ldquo;fresh-air&rdquo; dogs resided on his bounty and rolled in luxury on his lawns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cats, too, were prone to notice him, rising as he passed to hoist an
      interrogative tail and make tentative observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Washington Square, these, and the ragged children, knew him best of
      all. The children came from Minetta Lane and the purlieus south and west
      of it; the cats from the Mews, which Siward always thought most
      appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, as he passed the marble arch and entered the square, glancing
      behind him he saw the inevitable cat trotting, and, at his left, a very
      dirty little girl pretending to trundle a hoop, but plainly enough keeping
      sociable pace with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said Siward. The cat stopped; the child tossed her clustering
      curls, gave him a rapid but fearless sidelong glance, laughed, and ran on
      in the wake of her hoop. When she caught it she sat down on a bench
      opposite the fountain and looked around at Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's pretty warm, isn't it?&rdquo; said Siward, coming up and seating himself
      on the same bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you lame?&rdquo; asked the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your leg broken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your cat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward looked around; the cat was seated on the bench beside him. But he
      was accustomed to that sort of thing, and he caressed the creature with
      his gloved hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you rich?&rdquo; asked the child, shaking her blond curls from her eyes and
      staring up solemnly at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very,&rdquo; he answered, smiling. &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look rich, somehow,&rdquo; said the child shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! With these old and very faded clothes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, swinging her plump legs: &ldquo;You look it, somehow. It
      isn't the clothes that matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you one thing,&rdquo; said Siward, laughing &ldquo;I'm rich enough to buy
      all the hokey-pokey you can eat!&rdquo; and he glanced meaningly at the pedlar
      of that staple who had taken station between a vender of peaches and a
      Greek flower-seller.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child looked, too, but made no comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about it?&rdquo; asked Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd rather have something to remember you by,&rdquo; said the girl innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said, perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rose. They are five cents, and hokey-pokey costs that much&mdash;I
      mean, for as much as you can eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really want a rose?&rdquo; he said amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the child fell shy, and he beckoned the Greek and selected a dozen
      big, perfumed jacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the child sat silent, her ragged arms piled with roses, he asked
      her jestingly what else she desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I like to look at you,&rdquo; she answered simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I like to look at you. Will you tell me your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Molly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But that is all the information he could extract. Presently she said she
      was going, hesitated, looked a very earnest good-bye, and darted away
      across the park, her hoop over one arm, the crimson roses bobbing above
      her shoulders. Something in her flight attracted the errant cat, for she,
      too, jumped down and bounded after the little flying feet, but, catlike,
      halted half-way to scratch, and then forgetting what she was about,
      wandered off toward the Mews again, whence she had been lured by
      instinctive fascination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Siward, intensely amused, sat there in the late sunlight which streamed
      through the park, casting long shadows from the elms and sycamores. It was
      that time of the day, just before sunset, when the old square looked to
      him as he remembered it as a child. Even the marble arch, pink in the
      evening sun, did not disturb the harmony of his memories. He saw his
      father once more, walking home from down town, tall, slim, laughingly
      stopping to watch him as he played there with the other children&mdash;the
      nurses, seated in a row, crocheting under the sycamores; he saw the
      old-fashioned carriage pass, Mockett on the box, Wands beside him, and his
      pretty mother leaning forward to wave her hand to him as the long-tailed,
      long-maned horses wheeled into Fifth Avenue. Little unimportant scenes,
      trivial episodes, grew in the spectral garden of memory: the first time he
      ever saw Marion Page, when, aged five, she was attempting to get into the
      fountain, pursued by a shrieking nurse; and a certain flight across the
      grass he had indulged in with Leila Mortimer, then Leila Egerton, aged
      six, in hot pursuit, because she found that it bored him horribly to be
      kissed, and she was bound to do it. He had a fight once, over by that
      gnarled, old, silver poplar-tree, with Kemp Ferrall&mdash;he could not
      remember what about, only that they ended by unanimously assaulting their
      nurses and were dragged howling homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned, looking across to where the gray towers of the University once
      stood. There had been an old stone church there, too; and, south of that,
      old, old houses with hip-roofs and dormers where now the high white cliffs
      of modern architecture rose, riddled with tiny windows, every vane
      glittering in the sun. South, the old houses still remained, now degraded
      to sordid uses. North, the square, red-brick mansions, with their white
      pillars and steps, still faced the sunset&mdash;the last practically
      unbroken rank of the old rÃ©gime, the last of the old guard, standing fast
      and still confronting, still resisting the Inevitable looming in limestone
      and granite, story piled on story, aloft in the kindling, southern sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cab, driven smartly, passed through the park, the horses' feet slapping
      the asphalt till the echoes rattled back from the marble arch. He followed
      it idly with his eyes up Fifth Avenue; saw it suddenly halt in the middle
      of the street; saw a woman spring out, stand for a moment talking to her
      companion, then turn and look toward the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood so long, and she was so far away, that he presently grew tired
      of watching her. A dozen ragged urchins were prowling around the fountain,
      casting sidelong glances at a distant policeman. But it was not hot enough
      that evening to permit the children to splash in the water, and the
      policeman drove them off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little devils!&rdquo; said Siward to himself; and he rose, adjusted his
      crutches, and started through the park with a vague idea of seeing what
      could be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he limped onward, the sun level in his eyes, he heard somebody speak
      behind him, but did not catch the words or apply the hail to himself.
      Then, &ldquo;Mr. Siward!&rdquo; came the low, breathless voice at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart stopped as he did. The sun had dazzled his eyes, and when he
      turned on his crutches he could not see clearly for a second. That past,
      he looked at Sylvia, looked at her outstretched hand, took it
      mechanically, still staring at her with only a dazed unbelief in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in town for a day,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Leila Mortimer and I were driving up
      town from the bank when we saw you; and the next thing that happened was
      me, on Fifth Avenue, running after you&mdash;no, the next thing was my
      flying leap from the hansom, and my standing there looking down the street
      and across the square where you sat. Then Leila told me I was probably
      crazy, and I immediately confirmed her diagnosis by running after you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood laughing, flushed, sunburned, and breathless, her left hand
      still in his, her right hand laid over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, with a sudden change to anxiety, &ldquo;does it tire you to
      stand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I was going to saunter along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I saunter with you for a moment? I mean&mdash;I only mean, I am glad
      to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I am going to let you go now?&rdquo; he asked, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, then her eyes evaded his: &ldquo;Let us walk a little,&rdquo; she
      said, withdrawing her hand, &ldquo;if you think you are strong enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strong! Look, Sylvia!&rdquo; and he stood unsupported by his crutches, then
      walked a little way, slowly, but quite firmly. &ldquo;I am rather a coward about
      my foot, that is all. I shall not lug these things about after to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the doctor say you might?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, after to-day. I could walk home now without them. I could do a good
      many things I couldn't do a few minutes ago. Isn't that curious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; she said, avoiding his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. She dared not look at him. The excitement and impetus of sheer
      impulse had carried her this far; now all the sadness of it was clutching
      hard at her throat and for awhile she could not speak&mdash;walking there
      in her dainty, summer gown beside him, the very incarnation of youth and
      health, with the sea-tan on wrist and throat, and he, white, hollow-eyed,
      crippled, limping, at her elbow!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet at that very moment his whole frame seemed to glow and his heart
      clamour with the courage in it, for he was thinking of Plank's words and
      he knew Plank had spoken the truth. She could not give herself to
      Quarrier, if he stood firm. His was the stronger will after all; his was
      the right to interfere, to stop her, to check her, to take her, draw her
      back&mdash;as he had once drawn her from the fascination of destruction
      when she had swayed out too far over the cliffs at Shotover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember that?&rdquo; he asked, and spoke of the incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember,&rdquo; she replied, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctors say&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that there is a weak streak in people who are
      affected by great heights, or who find a dizzy fascination drawing them
      toward the brink of precipices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean me?&rdquo; she asked, amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he continued serenely: &ldquo;You have seen those pigeons called 'tumbler
      pigeons' suddenly turn a cart-wheel in mid-air? Scientists say it's not
      for pleasure they do it; it's because they get dizzy. In other words, they
      are not perfectly normal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said, laughing: &ldquo;Well, you never saw me turn a cart-wheel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a moral one,&rdquo; he replied airily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen, what on earth do you mean? You're not going to be disagreeable,
      are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to be so agreeable,&rdquo; he said, laughing, &ldquo;that you will find it
      very difficult to tear yourself away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of it, but I must, and very soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to let you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can't be helped,&rdquo; she said, looking up at him. &ldquo;I came in with Leila.
      We're asked to Lenox for the week's end. We go to Stockbridge on the early
      train to-morrow morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care,&rdquo; he said doggedly; &ldquo;I'm not going to let you go yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I took to my heels here in the park would you chase me, Stephen?&rdquo; she
      asked with mock anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and if I couldn't run fast enough I'd call that policeman. Now do
      you begin to understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I've always understood that you were spoiled. I'm partly guilty of
      the spoiling process, too. Listen: I'll walk with you a little way&rdquo;&mdash;she
      looked at him&mdash;&ldquo;a little way,&rdquo; she continued gently; &ldquo;then I must go.
      There is only a caretaker in our house and Leila will be furious if I
      leave her all alone. Besides, we're going to dine there and it won't be
      very gay if I don't give a few orders first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you brought your maid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then telephone her that you and Leila are dining out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, silly? Do you want us to dine somewhere with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want you! You've got to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen, it isn't best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to him impulsively: &ldquo;Oh, I do want to so much! Do you think I
      might? It is perfectly delicious to see you again. I&mdash;you have no
      idea&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; he said sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned, walking past the fountain toward Fifth Avenue again.
      Furtively she glanced at his hands with the city pallor on them as they
      grasped the cross-bars of the crutches, then looked up at his worn face.
      He was much thinner, but now in the softly fading light the shadows under
      the eyes and cheek-bones seemed less sharp, his face fuller and more
      boyish; the contour of head and shoulders, the short, crisp hair were as
      she remembered&mdash;and the old charm held her, the old fascination grew,
      tightening her throat, stealing through every vein, stirring her pulses,
      awakening imperceptibly once more the best in her. The twilight of a
      thousand years seemed to slip from the world as she looked out at it
      through eyes opening from a long, long sleep; the marble arch burned rosy
      in the evening glow; a fairy haze hung over the enchanted avenue,
      stretching away, away into the blue magic of the city of dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no use,&rdquo; she said under her breath; &ldquo;I can't go back to Leila.
      Stephen, the dreadful part of it is that I&mdash;I wish she were in
      Jericho! I wish the whole world were in Ballyhoo, and you and I alone once
      more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under their gay laughter quivered the undertone of excitement. Sylvia
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to talk to you all alone. It won't do, of course; but I may say
      what I'd like&mdash;mayn't I? What time is it? If I'm dining with you
      we've got to have Leila for convention's sake, if not from motives of
      sheer decency, which you and I seem to lack, Stephen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We lack decency,&rdquo; said Siward, &ldquo;and we're proud of it. As for Leila, I am
      going to arrange for her very simply but very beautifully. Plank will take
      care of her. Sylvia! There's not a soul in town and we can be as imprudent
      as we please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we can't. Agatha's at the Santa Regina. She came down with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we are not going to dine at the Santa Regina. We're going where
      Agatha wouldn't intrude her colourless nose&mdash;to a thoroughly
      unfashionable and selectly common resort overlooking the classic Harlem;
      and we're going to whiz thither in Plank's car, and remain thither until
      you yawn for mercy, whence we will return thence&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen, you silly! I'm perfectly mad to go with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be madder when you get there, if the table has not improved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Table! As though tables mattered on a night like this!&rdquo; Then with sudden
      self-reproach and quick solicitude: &ldquo;Am I making you walk too far?
      Wouldn't you like to go in now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not tired; I'm millions of years younger, and I'm as strong as
      the nine gods of your friend Porsena. Besides, haven't I waited for this?&rdquo;
       and under his breath, fiercely, &ldquo;Haven't I waited!&rdquo; he repeated, turning
      on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do&mdash;do you mean that as a reproach?&rdquo; she asked, lowering her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I knew you would not come on 'the first sunny day.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you think I would not come? Did you know me for the coward I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not think you would come,&rdquo; he repeated, halting to rest on his
      crutches. He stood, balanced, staring dreamily into the dim perspective;
      and again her fascinated eyes ventured to rest on the worn, white face,
      listless, sombre in its fixedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears were very near her eyes; the spasm in her throat checked speech.
      At length she stammered: &ldquo;I did not come b-because I simply couldn't stand
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face cleared as he turned quietly: &ldquo;Child, you must not confuse
      matters. You must not think of being sorry for me. The old order is
      passing&mdash;ticking away on every clock in the world. All that inverted
      order of things is being reversed. You don't know what I mean, do you? Ah,
      well; you will know when I grow into something of what you think you
      remember in me, and when I grow out of what I really was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly I don't understand, Stephen. But then&mdash;I am out of training
      since you went&mdash;went out of things. Have I changed? Do I seem more
      dull? I&mdash;it has not been very gay with me. I don't see&mdash;looking
      back across all the noise, all the chaos of the winter&mdash;I do not see
      how I stood it alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-not seeing you&mdash;sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with smiling, sceptical eyes. &ldquo;Didn't you enjoy the
      winter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you enjoy being drugged with champagne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face altered so quickly that, confused, she only stared at him, the
      fixed smile stamped on her lips; then, overwhelmed in the revelation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen, surely, surely you know what I meant! I did not mean that! Dear,
      do you dream for one moment that&mdash;that I could&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You have not hurt me. Besides, I know what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment he swung forward on his crutches, biting his lip, the frown
      gathering between his temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were passing the big, old-fashioned hotel with its white faÃ§ade and
      green blinds, a lingering landmark of the older city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll telephone here,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Side by side they went up the great, broad stoop and entered the lobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you'll speak to Leila, I'll get Plank on the wire. Say that we'll stop
      for you at seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave her number; then, at the nod of the operator, entered a small
      booth. Siward was given another booth in a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank answered from his office; his voice sounded grave and tired but it
      quickened, tinged with surprise, when Siward made known his plan for the
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mrs. Mortimer in town?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;I had a wire from her that she
      expected to be here and I hoped to see her at the station to-morrow on her
      way to Lenox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's stopping with Miss Landis. Can't you manage to come?&rdquo; asked Siward
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Do you wish it particularly? I have just seen Quarrier and
      Harrington. I can't quite understand Quarrier's attitude. There's a
      certain hint of defiance about it. Harrington is all caved in. He is ready
      to thank us for any mercies. But Quarrier&mdash;there's something I don't
      fancy, don't exactly understand about his attitude. He's like a dangerous
      man whom you've searched for concealed weapons, and who knows you've
      overlooked the knife up his sleeve. That's why I've expected to spend a
      quiet evening, studying up the matter and examining every loophole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got to dine somewhere,&rdquo; said Siward. &ldquo;If you could fix it to dine
      with us&mdash;But I won't urge you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I don't know why I shouldn't. I don't know why I feel this way
      about things. I&mdash;I rather felt&mdash;you'll laugh, Siward!&mdash;that
      somehow I'd better not go out of my own house to-night; that I was safer,
      better off in my own house, studying this Quarrier matter out. I'm tired,
      I suppose; and this man Quarrier has come close to worrying me. But it's
      all right, of course, if you wish it. You know I haven't any nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are tired&mdash;&rdquo; began Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I'm not. I'll go. Will you say that we'll stop for them at seven?
      Really, it's all right, Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to urge you,&rdquo; repeated Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not. I'll go. But&mdash;wait one moment tell me, did Quarrier know
      that Mrs. Mortimer was to stop with Miss Landis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment. Hold the wire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door of the booth and saw Sylvia waiting for him, seated by
      the operator's desk. She rose at once when she saw he wished to speak with
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me something,&rdquo; he said in a low voice; &ldquo;did Mr. Quarrier know that
      Leila was to stay overnight with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered quietly, surprised. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward nodded vaguely, closed the door again, and said to Plank:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Quarrier knows it. Do you think he'll be there to-night? I don't
      suppose Miss Landis and Mrs. Mortimer know he is in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank's troubled voice came back over the wire: &ldquo;I don't know. I don't
      know what to think. I suppose I'm a little, just a trifle, overworked.
      Somebody once said that I had one nerve in me somewhere, and Quarrier's
      probably found it; that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you think it better not to come&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll come. I'll stop for you in the motor. Don't worry, old fellow! And&mdash;take
      your fighting chance! Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward, absorbed in his own thoughts, rose and walked slowly out of the
      booth, utterly unconscious that he had left his crutches leaning upright
      in the corner. It was only the surprise dawning into tremulous delight on
      Sylvia's face that at last arrested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what you have done!&rdquo; he said, laughing through his own surprise.
      &ldquo;I've a mind to leave them there now, and trust to your new cure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she was instantly concerned and anxious, and entering the booth
      brought out the crutches and forced him to take them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No risks now!&rdquo; she said decisively. &ldquo;We have too much at stake this
      evening. Leila is coming. Isn't it perfectly delightful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; he said, his eyes full of the old laughing confidence again;
      &ldquo;and the most delightful part of it all is that you don't know how
      delightful it is going to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't I? Very well. Only I inform you that I mean to be perfectly happy!
      And that means that I'm going to do as I please! And that means&mdash;oh,
      it may mean anything! What are you laughing at, Stephen? I know I'm
      excited. I don't care! What girl wouldn't be? And I don't know what's
      ahead of me at all; and I don't want to know&mdash;I don't care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her reckless, little laugh rang sweetly in the old-fashioned, deserted
      hall; her lovely, daring eyes met his undaunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't make love to me, will you, Stephen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you promise me the same?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, silly! How do I know what I might say to you, you big,
      blundering boy, who can't take care of himself? I don't know at all; I
      won't promise. I'm likely to do anything to-night&mdash;even before Leila
      and Mr. Plank&mdash;when you are with me. Shame on you for the shameless
      girl you've educated!&rdquo; Her voice fell, tremulously, and for an instant
      standing there she remembered her education and his part in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slow colour in his face reflected the pink confusion in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O tongue! tongue!&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;I can't hold you in! I can't curb you,
      and I can't make you say what you ought to be saying to that boy. There's
      trouble coming for somebody; there's trouble here already! Call me a cab,
      Stephen, or I'll be dragging you into that big, old-fashioned parlour and
      planting you on a chair and placing myself opposite, to moon over you
      until somebody puts us out! There! Now will you call me a hansom?... And I
      will be all ready at seven.... And don't dare to keep me waiting one
      second!... Come before seven. You don't want to frighten me, do you? Very
      well then, at a quarter to seven&mdash;so I shall not be frightened. And,
      Stephen, Stephen, we're doing exactly what we ought not to do. You know
      it, don't you? So do I. Nothing can stop us, can it? Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XIV THE BARGAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      If a man's grief does not awaken his dignity, then he has none. In that
      event, grief is not even respectable. And so it was with Leroy Mortimer
      when Lydia at last turned on him. If you caress an Angora too long and too
      persistently it runs away. And before it goes it scratches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under all the physical degeneration of mind and flesh there had still
      remained in Mortimer the capacity for animal affection; and that does not
      mean sensuality alone, but generosity and a sort of routine devotion as
      characteristic components of a character which had now disintegrated into
      the simplest and most primitive elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia Vyse left Saratoga when the financial stringency began to make it
      unpleasant for her to remain. She told Mortimer without the slightest
      compunction that she was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not believe her and he gave her the new car&mdash;the big
      yellow-and-black Serin-Chanteur. She sold it the same day to a bookmaker&mdash;an
      old friend of hers; withdrew several jewels from limbo&mdash;gems which
      Mortimer had given her&mdash;and gathered together everything for which,
      if he turned ugly, she might not be criminally liable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never liked him&mdash;she had long disliked him. Such women have
      an instinct for their own kind, and no matter how low in the scale a man
      of the other kind sinks he can never entirely supply the type of running
      mate that such women require, understand, and usually conceive a passion
      for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not liking him she had no hesitation in the matter; disliking him,
      whatever unpleasant had occurred during their companionship remained as an
      irritant to poison memory. She resented a thousand little incidents that
      he scarcely knew had ever existed, but which she treasured without wasting
      emotion until the sum total and the time coincided to retaliate. Not that
      she would have cared to harm him seriously; she was willing enough to
      disoblige him, however&mdash;decorate him, before she left him, with one
      extra scratch for the sake of auld lang syne. So she wrote a note to the
      governors of the Patroons Club, saying that both Quarrier and Mortimer
      were aware that the guilt of her escapade could not be attached to Siward;
      that she knew nothing of Siward, had accepted his wager without meaning to
      attempt to win it, had never again seen him, and had, on the impulse of
      the moment, made her entry in the wake of several men. She added that when
      Quarrier, as governor, had concurred in Siward's expulsion he knew
      perfectly well that Siward was not guilty, because she herself had so
      informed Quarrier. Since then she had also told Mortimer, but he had taken
      no steps to do justice to Siward, although he, Mortimer, was still a
      governor of the Patroons Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being about all she could think of to make mischief for two men whose
      recent companionship had nourished and irritated her, she shipped her
      trunks by express, packed her jewel-case and valise, and met Desmond at
      the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desmond had business in Europe; Lydia had as much business there as
      anywhere; and, although she had been faithless to Mortimer for a
      comparatively short time, within that time Desmond already had sworn at
      her and struck her. So she was quite ready to follow Desmond anywhere in
      this world or the next. And that, too, had not made her the more
      considerate toward Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the latter returned from the races to find her gone the last riddled
      props to what passed for his manhood gave way and the rotten fabric came
      crashing into the mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had loved her as far as he had been capable of imitating that passion
      on the transposed plane to which he had fallen; he was stupefied at first,
      then grew violent with the furniture, then hysterically profane, then
      pitiable in the abandoned degradation of his grief. And, suspecting
      Desmond, he started to find him. They put him out of Desmond's club-house
      when he became noisy; they refused him admittance to several similar
      resorts where his noise threatened to continue; his landlord lost no time
      in interviewing him upon the subject of damage to furniture from kicks and
      to the walls and carpets from the contents of smashed bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creditors with sharp noses scented the whirlwind afar off and hemmed him
      in with unsettled accounts, mostly hers. Somebody placed a lien on his
      horses; a deputy sheriff began to follow him about; all credit ceased as
      by magic, and men crossed the street to avoid meeting with an old
      companion in direst need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, alternately stupefied by his own grief and maddened into the
      necessity for action, he packed a suitcase, crawled out of the rear door,
      toiled across country and found a farmer to drive him twenty miles over a
      sandy road to a local railroad crossing, where he managed to board a train
      for Albany.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Albany, as he stood panting and sweating on the long, concrete platform
      which paralleled track No. 1, he saw a private car, switched from a Boston
      and Albany train, shunted to the rear of the Merchants' Express.
    </p>
    <p>
      The private car was lettered in gold on the central panel, &ldquo;Algonquin.&rdquo; He
      boarded the Pullman coupled to it forward, pushed through the vestibule,
      shoved aside the Japanese steward and darky cook, forcing his way straight
      into the private car. Quarrier, reading a magazine, looked up at him in
      astonishment. For a full moment neither spoke. Then Mortimer dropped his
      suit-case, sat down in an armchair opposite Quarrier, and leisurely mopped
      his reeking face and neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scotch and lithia!&rdquo; he said hoarsely; the Japanese steward looked at
      Quarrier; then, at that gentleman's almost imperceptible nod, went away to
      execute the commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      He executed a great many similar commissions during the trip to New York.
      When they arrived there at five o'clock, Quarrier offered Mortimer his
      hand, and held the trembling, puffy fingers as he leaned closer, saying
      with cold precision and emotionless emphasis something that appeared to
      require the full concentration of Mortimer's half-drugged faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when at length Mortimer drove away in a hansom, Quarrier's Japanese
      steward went with him&mdash;perhaps to carry his suit case&mdash;a
      courtesy that did credit to Quarrier's innate thoughtfulness and
      consideration for others. He was very considerate; he even called Agatha
      up on the telephone and talked with her for ten minutes. Then he
      telephoned to Plank's office, learned that Harrington was already there,
      telephoned the garage for a Mercedes which he always kept ready in town,
      and presently went bowling away to a conference on which the last few
      hours had put an entirely new aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had taken Plank only a few minutes to perceive that something had
      occurred to change a point of view which he had believed it impossible for
      Quarrier to change. Something had gone wrong in his own careful
      calculations; some cog had slipped, some rivet given way, some bed-plate
      cracked. And Harrington evidently had not been aware of it; but Quarrier
      knew it. There was something wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too late now to go tinkering in the dark for trouble. Plank
      understood that. Coolly, as though utterly unaware that the machinery
      might not stand the strain, he started it full speed. And when he stopped
      it at last Harrington's grist had been ground to atoms, and Quarrier had
      looked on without comment. There seemed to be little more for them to do
      except to pay the miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said Quarrier, rising to go. It was on the edge of Plank's
      lips to say, &ldquo;to-day!&rdquo;&mdash;but he was silent, knowing that Harrington
      would speak for him. And the old man did, without words, turning his iron
      visage on Quarrier with the silent dignity of despair. But Quarrier coldly
      demanded a day before they reckoned with Plank. And Plank, profoundly
      disturbed, shrugged his massive shoulders in contemptuous assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Quarrier and Harrington went away&mdash;the younger partner taking
      leave of the older with a sneer for an outworn prop which no man could
      ever again have use for. Old and beaten&mdash;that was all Harrington now
      stood for in Quarrier's eyes. Never a thought of the past undaunted
      courage, never a memory of the old victories which had made the Quarrier
      fortune possible&mdash;only contempt for age, a sneer for the mind and
      body that had failed at last. The old robber was done for, his armour
      rotten, his buckler broken, his sword blade rusted to the core. The least
      of his victims might now finish him with a club where he swayed in his
      loosened saddle, or leave him to that horseman on the pale horse watching
      him yonder on the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      For now, whether Harrington lived or died, he must be counted as nothing
      in this new struggle darkly outlining its initial strategy in Quarrier's
      brain. What was coming was coming between himself and Plank alone; and
      whatever the result&mdash;whether an armed truce leaving affairs
      indefinitely in statu quo, or the other alternative, an alliance with
      Plank, leaving Harrington like a king in his mail, propped upon his
      throne, dead eyes doubly darkened under the closed helmet&mdash;the result
      must be attained swiftly, with secrecy, and with the aid of no man. For he
      did not count Mortimer a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Quarrier's thin lips twitched and the glimmer of teeth showed under the
      silky beard as he listened without comment to the old man's hesitating
      words&mdash;a tremulous suggestion for a conference that evening&mdash;and
      he said again, &ldquo;to-morrow,&rdquo; and left him there alone, groping with
      uncertain hands toward the door of the hired coupÃ© which had brought him
      to the place of his earthly downfall; the place where he had met his own
      weird face to face&mdash;the wraith that bore the mask of Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier, brooding sullenly in his Mercedes, was already far up town on
      his way to Major Belwether's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door, Sylvia's maid received him smilingly, saying that her
      mistress was not at home but that Mrs. Mortimer was&mdash;which saved
      Quarrier the necessity of asking for the private conference with Leila
      which was exactly what he had come for. But her first unguarded words on
      receiving him as he rose at her entrance into the darkened drawing-room
      changed that plan, too&mdash;changed it all so utterly, and so much for
      the better, that he almost smiled to think of the crudity of human
      combinations and inventions as compared to the masterly machinations of
      Fate. No need for him to complicate matters when here were pawns enough to
      play the game for him. No need for him to do anything except give them
      their initial velocity and let them tumble into one another and totter or
      fall. Leila said, laughingly: &ldquo;Oh, you are too late, Howard. We are dining
      with Mr. Plank at Riverside Inn. What in the world are you doing in town
      so suddenly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A business telegram. I might have come down with you and Sylvia if I had
      known.... Is Plank dining with you alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't seen him,&rdquo; smiled Leila evasively. &ldquo;He will tell us his plans
      of course when he comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Quarrier, dropping his eyes and glancing furtively toward the
      curtained windows through which he could see the street and his Mercedes
      waiting at the curb. At the same instant a hansom drove up; Sylvia sprang
      out, ran lightly up the low steps, and the silent, shrouded house rang
      with the clamour of the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leila looked curiously at Quarrier, who sat motionless, head partly
      averted, as though listening to something heard by him alone. He believed
      perhaps that he was listening to the voice of Fate again, and it may have
      been so, for already, for the third time, all his plans were changing to
      suit this new ally of his&mdash;this miraculous Fate which was shaping
      matters for him as he waited. Sylvia had started up-stairs like a fragrant
      whirlwind, but her flying feet halted at Leila's constrained voice from
      the drawing-room, and she spun around and came into the darkened room like
      an April breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leila! They'll be here at a quarter to seven&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her breath seemed to leave her body as a shadowy figure rose in the
      uncertain light and confronted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said: &ldquo;Didn't you recognise the Mercedes outside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had not even seen it, so excited, so deeply engaged had she been with
      the riotous tumult of her own thoughts. And still her hurt, unbelieving
      gaze widened to dismay as she stood there halted on the threshold; and
      still his eyes, narrowing, held her under their expressionless inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you come? Why?&rdquo; she asked in an altered voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came on business. Naturally, being here, I came to see you. I
      understand you are dining out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we are dining out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry I didn't wire you because we might have dined together. I saw
      Plank this afternoon. He did not say you were to dine with him. Shall I
      see you later in the evening, Sylvia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;it will be too late&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! To-morrow then. What train do you take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia did not answer; he picked up his hat, repeating the question
      carelessly, and still she made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I see you to-morrow?&rdquo; he asked, swinging on her rather suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think&mdash;not. I&mdash;there will be no time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed quietly to Leila, offering his hand. &ldquo;Who did you say was to dine
      with you&mdash;besides Plank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila stood silent, then, withdrawing her fingers, walked to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier, his hat in his gloved hands, looked from one to the other, his
      inquiring eyes returning and focused on Sylvia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you dining with?&rdquo; he asked with authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Plank and Mr. Siward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Siward!&rdquo; he repeated in surprised displeasure, as though he had not
      already divined it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. A man I like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man I dislike,&rdquo; he rejoined with the slightest emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I, Sylvia. And I am going to ask you to make him an excuse. Any
      excuse will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse? What do you mean, Howard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that I do not care to have you seen with Mr. Siward. Have I ever
      demanded very much of you, Sylvia? Very well; I demand this of you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And still she stood there, her eyes wide, her colour gone, repeating:
      &ldquo;Excuse? What excuse? What do you mean by 'excuse,' Howard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you. You know my wishes. If he has a telephone you can
      communicate with him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And say that I&mdash;that you forbid me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you choose. Yes; say that I object to him. Is there anything
      extraordinary in a man objecting to his future wife dining in the country
      at a common inn with a notorious outcast from every decent club and circle
      in New York?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; she whispered, white as death. &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I repeat what everybody except you seems to be aware of? Do you
      care to have me explain to you exactly why decent people have ostracised
      this man with whom you are proposing to figure in a public resort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Leila, who stood at the window, her back turned toward them:
      &ldquo;Mrs. Mortimer, when Mr. Plank arrives, you will be kind enough to explain
      why Sylvia is unable to accompany you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Leila heard she neither turned nor made sign of comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will dine at the Santa Regina,&rdquo; he said to Sylvia. &ldquo;Agatha is there
      and I'll find somebody at the club to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why bother to find anybody?&rdquo; said Leila, wheeling on him, exasperated.
      &ldquo;Why not dine there with Agatha alone? It will not be the first time I
      fancy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he said fiercely, under his breath. The colour had
      left his face, too, and in his eyes Leila saw for the first time an
      expression that she had never before surprised in any eyes except her
      husband's. It was the expression of fright; she recognised it. But Sylvia
      stared, unenlightened, at an altered visage she scarcely knew for
      Quarrier's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I mean?&rdquo; repeated Leila; &ldquo;I mean what I say; and if you don't
      understand it you can find the key to it, I fancy. Nor shall I answer to
      you for my guests. I invite whom I choose. Mr. Siward is one, Mr. Plank is
      another. Sylvia, if you care to come I shall be delighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do care to come,&rdquo; said Sylvia. Her heart was beating violently, her
      eyes were on Quarrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you go,&rdquo; said Quarrier, showing the glimmering edge of teeth under his
      beard, &ldquo;you will answer to me for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will answer you now, Howard; I am going with Mrs. Mortimer. What have
      you to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll say it to-morrow,&rdquo; he replied, contemplating her in a dull,
      impassive manner as though absorbed in other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say what there is to be said now!&rdquo; she insisted, the hot colour staining
      her cheeks again. &ldquo;Do you desire me to free you? Is that all? I will if
      you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. And I shall not free you, Sylvia. This&mdash;all this can be adjusted
      in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; she said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In time,&rdquo; he repeated, his passionless voice now under perfect control.
      He turned and looked at Leila; all the wickedness of his anger was
      concentrated in his gaze. Then he took his leave of them as formally, as
      precisely as though he had forgotten the whole scene; and a minute later
      the big Mercedes ran out into a half-circle, backed, wheeled, and rolled
      away through the thickening dusk, the glare of the acetylenes sweeping the
      deserted street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the twilight sped Quarrier, head bent, but his soft, dark-lashed eyes
      of a woman fixed steadily ahead. Every energy, every thought was now bent
      to this newest phase of the same question which he and Fate were finding
      simpler to solve every minute. Of all the luxuries he permitted himself
      openly or furtively, one&mdash;the rarest of them all&mdash;his
      self-denial had practically eliminated from the list: the luxury of
      punishing where no end was served save that of mere personal satisfaction.
      The temptation of this luxury now presented itself; and the means of
      gratification were so simple, so secret, so easy to command, that the
      temptation became almost a duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Siward he had not turned out of his way to injure; Siward had been in the
      way, that was all, and his ruin was to have been merely an agreeable
      coincidence with the purposed ruin of Amalgamated Electric before
      Inter-County absorbed the fragments. But here was a new phase; Mrs.
      Mortimer, whom he had expected to use, and if necessary sacrifice, had
      suddenly turned vicious. And he now hated her as coldly as he hated Major
      Belwether for betraying suspicions of a similar nature. As for Plank, fear
      and hatred of him was becoming hatred and contempt. He had the means of
      checking Plank if Mortimer did not drop dead before midnight. There
      remained Sylvia, whom he had selected as the fittest object attainable to
      transmit his name. Long ago, whatever of liking, of affection, of passion
      he had ever entertained for her had quieted to indifference and the
      unemotional contemplation of a future methodically arranged for. Now of a
      sudden, this young girl he had bought&mdash;he knowing what she sold and
      what he was paying for&mdash;had become exposed to the infection of a
      suspicion concerning himself and another woman; a woman unmarried, and of
      his own caste, and numbered among her own friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he knew enough of Sylvia to know that if anybody could once arouse her
      suspicion nothing on earth could induce her to look into his face again.
      Suppose Leila should do so this evening?
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly Quarrier had several matters to ponder over and provide for; and
      first and foremost of all to provide for his own security and the vital
      necessity of preserving his name and his character untainted. In this he
      had to deal with that miserable judge who had betrayed him; with Mortimer,
      who had once black-mailed him and who now was temporarily in his service;
      with Mrs. Mortimer, who&mdash;God knew how, when, or where&mdash;had
      become suspicious of Agatha and himself; with Major Belwether, who had
      deserted him before he could sacrifice the major, and whom he now hated
      and feared for having stumbled over suspicions similar to Mrs. Mortimer's.
      He had to deal with Sylvia herself, and with Siward&mdash;reckon with
      Siward's knowledge of matters which it were best that Sylvia should not
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      But first of all, and most important of all, he had to deal with Beverly
      Plank. And he was going to do it in a manner that Plank could not have
      foreseen; he was going to stop Plank where he stood, and to do this he was
      deliberately using his knowledge of the man and paying Plank the
      compliment of counting on his sense of honour to defeat him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For he had suddenly found the opportunity to defend himself; he had
      discovered the joint in Plank's old-fashioned armour&mdash;the armour of
      the old paladins&mdash;who placed a woman's honour before all else in the
      world. Now, through his creature, Mortimer, he could menace Plank with a
      threat to involve him and Leila in a vile publicity; now he was in a
      position to demand a hearing and a compromise through his new ambassador,
      Mortimer, knowing that he could at last halt Plank by threatening Leila
      with this shameful danger. Plank must sign the truce or face with Leila an
      action for damages and divorce.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all he went to the Lenox Club and dressed. Then he dined
      sparingly and alone. The Mercedes was waiting when he came out ready to
      run down to the great Hotel Corona, whither the Japanese steward had
      conducted Mortimer. Mortimer had dined heavily, but his disorganised
      physical condition was such that it had scarcely affected him at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Quarrier went over patiently and carefully the very simple part he
      had reserved for Mortimer that evening, explaining exactly what to say to
      Leila and what to say to Plank in case of insolent interruption. Then he
      told Mortimer to be ready at nine o'clock, turned on his heel with a curt
      word to the Japanese, descended to the street, entered his motor-car
      again, and sped away to the Hotel Santa Regina.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Caithness was at home, came the message in exchange for his cards for
      Agatha and Mrs. Vendenning. He entered the gilded elevator, stepped out on
      the sixth floor into a tiny, rococo, public reception-room. Nobody was
      there besides himself; Agatha's maid came presently, and he turned and
      followed her into the large and very handsome parlour belonging to the
      suite which Agatha was occupying with Mrs. Vendenning for the few days
      that they were to stop in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; she said serenely, sauntering in, her long, pale hands bracketed
      on her narrow hips, her lips disclosing her teeth in a smile so like that
      nervous muscular recession which passed for a smile on Quarrier's visage
      that for one moment he recognised it and thought she was mocking him. But
      she strolled up to him, meeting his eye calmly, and lifted her slim neck,
      lips passive under his impetuous kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mrs. Vendenning out?&rdquo; he asked, laying his hands on the bare shoulders
      of the tall, pallid girl&mdash;tall as he, and as pallid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mrs. Ven. is in, Howard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now? You mean she is coming in to interrupt&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no; she isn't fond of you, Howard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said&mdash;&rdquo; he began almost angrily, but she laid her fingers across
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said a very foolish thing, Howard. I said that I'd manage to dispense
      with Mrs. Ven. this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that you couldn't manage it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; I could easily have managed it. But&mdash;I didn't care to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him calmly at close range as he held her embraced, lifted
      her arms and, with slender, white fingers patted her hair into place where
      his arm around her head had disarranged it, watching him all the while out
      of her pale, haunted eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promised me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Howard! Do men still believe in promises?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier's face had colour enough now; his voice, too, had lost its
      passionless, monotonous precision. Whatever was in the man of emotion was
      astir; his impatient voice, his lack of poise, the almost human lack of
      caution in his speech betrayed him in a new and interesting light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Agatha, how long is this going to last? Are you trying to make
      a fool of me? What is the matter? Is there anything wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong? Oh dear no! How could there be anything wrong between you and me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agatha, what is the matter! Look here; let's settle this thing now and
      settle it one way or the other! I won't stand it; I&mdash;I can't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said, releasing herself from his tightening arms and
      stepping back with another glance at the mirror and another light touch of
      her finger-tips on her burnished hair. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she repeated, gazing
      again into the mirror; &ldquo;what am I to understand, Howard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what to understand,&rdquo; he said in a low voice; &ldquo;you know what we
      both understood when&mdash;when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I&mdash;when you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh what, Howard?&rdquo; she prompted indolently; and he answered in brutal
      exasperation, and for the first time so plainly that a hint of rose tinted
      her strange, pale beauty and between her lips the breath came less
      regularly as she stood there looking at the dull, silvery rug under her
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever misunderstand me?&rdquo; he demanded hotly. &ldquo;Did I give you any
      chance to? Were you ignorant of what that meant,&rdquo; with a gesture toward
      the splendid crescent of flashing gems, scintillating where the low, lace
      bodice met the silky lustre of her skin. &ldquo;Did you misinterpret the collar?
      Or the sudden change of fortune in your own family's concerns? Answer me,
      Agatha, once for all. But you need not answer after all: I know you have
      never misunderstood me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I misunderstood nothing,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you are quite right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do?&rdquo; she asked in slow surprise. &ldquo;What am I to do, Howard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have said that you loved me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said the truth, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long are you going to keep me at arm's length?&rdquo; he asked violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That lies with you,&rdquo; she said, smiling. She looked at him for a moment,
      then, resting her hands on her hips, she began to pace the floor, to and
      fro, to and fro, and at every turn she raised her head to look at him. All
      the strange grace of her became insolent provocation&mdash;her pale eyes,
      clear, limpid, harbouring no delusions, haunted with the mockery of
      wisdom, challenged and checked him. &ldquo;Howard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why should I be
      the fool you want me to be because I love you? Why should I be even if I
      wished to be? You desire an understanding? VoilÃ ! You have it. I love you;
      I never misunderstood you from the first; I could not afford to. You know
      what I am; you know what you arouse in me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slim, pale, depraved in all but body she stood, eyeing him a moment, the
      very incarnation of vicious perversity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what you arouse in me,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;But don't count on it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have encouraged&mdash;permitted me to count&mdash;&rdquo; His anger choked
      him&mdash;or was it the haunting wisdom of her eyes that committed him to
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; she said, musingly, &ldquo;what it is in you that I am so mad
      about&mdash;whether it is your brutality, or the utter corruption of you
      that holds me, or your wicked eyes of a woman, or the fascination of the
      mask you turn on the world, and the secret visage, naked in its vice, that
      you reserve for me. But I love you&mdash;in my own fashion. Count on that,
      Howard; for that is all you can surely count on. And now, at last, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he stood there, it came to him slowly that, deep within him he had
      always known this; that he had never really counted on anything else
      though he had throttled his doubts by covering her throat with diamonds.
      Her strangeness, her pallor, her acquiescence, the delicate hint of
      depravity in her, the subtle response to all that was worst in him had
      attracted him, only to learn, little by little, that the taint of
      corruption was only a taint infecting others, not her; that the promise of
      evil was only a promise; that he had to deal with a young body but an old
      intelligence, and a mind so old that at moments her faded gaze almost
      appalled him with its indolent clairvoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long since he knew, too, that in all the world he could never again find
      such a mate for him. This had, unadmitted even to himself, always remained
      a hidden secret within this secret man&mdash;an unacknowledged, undrawn-on
      reserve in case of the failure which he, even in sanguine moods, knew in
      his inmost corrupted soul that his quest was doomed to.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he had no more need of secrets from himself; now, turning his gaze
      inward, he looked upon all with which he had chosen to deceive himself.
      And there was nothing left for self-deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I marry you!&rdquo; he said calmly &ldquo;at least I know what I am getting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will marry you, Howard. I've got to marry somebody pretty soon. You or
      Captain Voucher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant a vicious light flashed in his narrowing eyes. She saw it
      and shook her head with weary cynicism:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not that. It could not attract me even with you. It is really vulgar&mdash;that
      arrangement. Noblesse oblige, mon ami. There is a depravity in marrying
      you that makes all lesser vices stale as virtues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing; she looked at him, lazily amused; then, inattentive,
      turned and paced the floor again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I see you to-morrow?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish. Captain Voucher came down on the same train with me. I'll
      set him adrift if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he preparing for a declaration?&rdquo; sneered Quarrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well if he comes to-night after I'm gone, you wait a final word from me.
      Do you understand?&rdquo; he repeated with repressed violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Howard. Are you going to propose to me to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll know to-morrow,&rdquo; he retorted angrily. &ldquo;I tell you to wait. I've a
      right to that much consideration anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Howard,&rdquo; she said, recognising in him the cowardice which she
      had always suspected to be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bade him good night; he touched her hand but made no offer to kiss
      her. She laughed a little to herself, watching him striding toward the
      elevator, then, closing the door, she stood still in the centre of the
      room, staring at her own reflection, full length, in the gilded
      pier-glass, her lips edged with a sneer so like Quarrier's that, the next
      moment she laughed aloud, imitating Quarrier's rare laugh from sheer
      perversity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said to her reflected figure in the glass, &ldquo;I think that
      you are either mentally ill or inherently a kind of devil. And I don't
      much care which.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she turned leisurely, her slim hands balanced lightly on her narrow
      hips, and strolled into the second dressing-room, where Mrs. Vendenning
      sat sullenly indulging in that particular species of solitaire known as
      &ldquo;The Idiot's Delight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Vendenning, looking up at the tall, pale girl she
      was chaperoning so carefully during their sojourn in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know the rhyme to that,&rdquo; yawned Agatha; &ldquo;let's ring up somebody.
      I'm bored stiff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did Howard Quarrier want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows, I think, but he hasn't yet informed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you one thing, Agatha,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vendenning, gathering up the
      packs for a new shuffle: &ldquo;Grace Ferrall doesn't fancy Howard's attention
      to you and she's beginning to say so. When you go back to Shotover you'd
      better let him alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going back to Shotover,&rdquo; said Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don't think so. However, I'll let you know to-morrow. It all
      depends&mdash;but I don't expect to.&rdquo; She turned as her maid tapped on the
      door. &ldquo;Oh, Captain Voucher. Are you at home to him?&rdquo; flipping the
      pasteboard onto the table among the scattered cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vendenning aggressively, &ldquo;unless you expect him to flop
      down on his knees to-night. Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't&mdash;to-night. Perhaps to-morrow. I don't know; I can't tell
      yet.&rdquo; And to her maid she nodded that they were at home to Captain
      Voucher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quarrier had met him, too, just as he was leaving the hotel lobby. They
      exchanged the careful salutations of men who had no use for one another.
      On the Englishman's clean-cut face a deeper hue settled as he passed; on
      Quarrier's, not a trace of emotion; but when he entered his motor he sat
      bolt upright, stiff-backed and stiff-necked, his long gray-gloved fingers
      moving restlessly over his pointed heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was magnificent; myriads of summer stars spangled the heavens.
      Even in the reeking city itself a slight freshness grew in the air,
      although there was no wind to stir the parched leaves of the park trees,
      among which fire-flies floated&mdash;their intermittent phosphorescence
      breaking out with a silvery, star-like brilliancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank, driving his big motor northward through the night, Leila Mortimer
      beside him, twice mistook the low glimmer of a fire-fly for the distant
      lamp of a motor, which amused Leila, and her clear, young laughter floated
      back to the ears of Sylvia and Siward, curled up in their corners of the
      huge tonneau. But they were too profoundly occupied with each other to
      heed the sudden care-free laughter of the young matron, though in these
      days her laughter was infrequent enough to set the more merciless tongues
      wagging when it did sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank had never seen fit to speak to her of her husband's scarcely veiled
      menace that day he had encountered him in the rotunda of the Algonquin
      Trust Company. His first thought was to do so&mdash;to talk it over with
      her, consider the threat and the possibility of its seriousness, and then
      come to some logical and definite decision as to what their future
      relations should be. Again and again he had been on the point of doing
      this when alone with Leila&mdash;uncomfortable, even apprehensive, because
      of their frank intimacy; but he had never had the opportunity to do so
      without deliberately dragging in the subject by the ears in all its
      ugliness and implied reproach for her imprudence, and seeing that
      dreadful, vacant change in Leila's face, which the mere mention of her
      husband's name was sure to bring, turn into horror unspeakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man not prone to fear his fellows, he now feared Mortimer, but that fear
      struck him only through Leila&mdash;or had so reached him until the days
      of his closing struggle with Quarrier. Whether the long strain had
      unnerved him, whether minutely providing against every possible danger he
      had been over-scrupulous, over-anxious, morbidly exact&mdash;or whether a
      foresight almost abnormal had evoked a sinister possibility&mdash;he did
      not know; but that threat of Mortimer's to involve Plank with Leila in one
      common ruin, that boast that he was able to do so could not be ignored as
      a possible weapon if Quarrier should by any chance learn of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all his life he had taken Leila into his arms but once; had kissed her
      but once&mdash;but that once had been enough to arm Mortimer with danger
      from head to foot. Some prying servant had either listened or seen&mdash;perhaps
      a glimmer of a mirror had betrayed them. At all events, whoever had seen
      or heard had informed Mortimer, and now the man was equipped; the one and
      only man in all the world who could with truth accuse Plank; the only man
      of whom he stood in honest fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was characteristic of Plank that never for one moment had it
      occurred to him that the sheer fault of it all lay with Leila; that it was
      her imprudence alone that now threatened herself and the man she loved&mdash;that
      threatened his very success in life as long as Mortimer should live.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this, Plank, in his thorough, painstaking review of the subject, had
      taken into account; and he could not see how it could possibly bear upon
      the matters now finally to be adjusted between Quarrier and himself,
      because Quarrier was in New York and Mortimer in Saratoga, and unless the
      latter had already sold his information the former could not strike at him
      through knowledge of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet a curious reluctancy, a hesitation inexplicable&mdash;unless
      overwork explained it&mdash;had come over him when Siward had proposed
      their dining together on the very eve of his completed victory over
      Quarrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed absurd, and Plank was too stolid to entertain superstitions, but
      he could not, even with Leila laughing there beside him, shake off the
      dull instinct that all was not well&mdash;that Quarrier's attitude was
      still the attitude of a dangerous man; that he, Plank, should have had
      this evening in his room alone to study out the matters he had so
      patiently plodded through in the long hours while Siward slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet not for one instant did he dream of shifting the responsibility&mdash;if
      responsibility entailed blame&mdash;on Siward, who, against Plank's
      judgment and desire, had on the very eve of consummation drawn him away
      from that sleepless vigilance which must for ever be the price of a
      business man's safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leila, gay and excited as a schoolgirl, chattered on ceaselessly to Plank;
      all the silence, all the secrecy of the arid years turning to laughter on
      her red lips, pouring out, in broken phrases of delight, words strung
      together for the sheer pleasure of speech and the happiness of her lot to
      be with him unrestrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered once listening to the song of a wild bird on the edge of a
      clearing at night, and how, standing entranced, the low, distant jar of
      thunder sounded at moments, scarcely audible&mdash;like his heart now, at
      intervals, dully persistent amid the gaiety of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And would you believe it, Beverly,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I formed the habit at
      Shotover of walking across the boundary and strolling into your
      greenhouses and deliberately helping myself. And every time I did it I was
      certain one of your men would march me out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, but did not tell her that his men had reported the first
      episode and that he had instructed them that Mrs. Mortimer and her friends
      were to do exactly as they pleased at the Fells. However she knew it,
      because a garrulous gardener, proud of his service with Plank, had
      informed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beverly,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are a dear. If people only knew what I know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to turn red; she could see it even in the flickering, lamp-shot
      darkness. And she teased him for a while, very gently, even tenderly; and
      their voices grew lower in a half-serious badinage that ended with a
      quiet, indrawn breath, a sigh, and silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the river swept into view, a darkly luminous sheet set with
      reflected stars. Mirrored lights gleamed in it; sudden bright, yellow
      flashes zigzagged into its sombre depths; the foliage edged it with a
      deeper gloom over which, on the heights, twinkled the multicoloured lights
      of Riverside Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up the broad, gentle grade they sped, curving in and out among the clumps
      of trees and shrubbery, then on a level, sweeping in a great circle up to
      the steps of the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now all about them from the brilliantly lighted verandas the gay tumult
      broke out like an uproarious welcome after the swift silence of their
      journey; the stir of jolly people keen for pleasure; the clatter of
      crockery; the coming and going of waiters, of guests, of hansoms, coupÃ©s,
      victorias, and scores of motor-cars wheeling and turning through the
      blinding glare of their own headlights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere a gipsy orchestra, full of fitful crescendoes and throbbing
      suspensions of caprice, furnished resonant accompaniment to the joyous
      clamour; the scent of fountain spray and flowers was in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know you had telephoned for a table,&rdquo; said Siward, as a
      head-waiter came up smiling and bowing to Plank. &ldquo;I confess, in the new
      excitement of things, I clean forgot it! What a man you are to think of
      other people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plank reddened again, muttering something evasive, and went forward with
      Leila.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia, moving leisurely beside Siward who was walking slowly but
      confidently without crutches, whispered to him: &ldquo;I never really liked Mr.
      Plank before I understood his attitude toward you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a man, every inch,&rdquo; said Siward simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that generally includes what men of your sort demand, doesn't
      it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men of my sort sometimes demand in others what they themselves are
      lacking in,&rdquo; said Siward, laughing. &ldquo;Sylvia, look at this jolly crowd!
      Look at all those tables! It seems an age since I have done anything of
      this sort. I feel like a boy of eighteen&mdash;the same funny, quickening
      fascination in me toward everything gay and bright and alive!&rdquo; He looked
      around at her, laughingly. &ldquo;As for you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you look about sixteen.
      You certainly are the most beautiful thing this beautiful world ever saw!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Schoolboy courtship!&rdquo; she mocked him, lingering as he made his slow way
      through the crowded place. The tint of excitement was in her eyes and
      cheeks; the echo of it in her low, happy voice. &ldquo;Where on earth is Mr.
      Plank? Oh, I see them! They have a table by the balcony rail, in the
      corner; and it seems to be rather secluded, Stephen, so I shall, of
      course, expect you to say nothing further about beauty of any species.
      ...Are you a trifle tired? No?... Well, you need not be indignant. I don't
      care whether you tumble. Indeed, I don't believe there is really anything
      the matter with you&mdash;you are walking with the same old careless
      saunter. Mr. Plank,&rdquo; as they arrived and seated themselves, &ldquo;Mr. Siward
      has just admitted that he uses crutches only because they are ornamental.
      Leila, isn't this air delicious? All sorts of people, too, aren't there,
      Mr. Plank? Such curious-looking women, some of them&mdash;quite pretty,
      too, in a certain way. Are you hungry, St&mdash;Mr. Siward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you, St&mdash;Mr. Siward?&rdquo; mimicked Leila promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Siward, laughing at Sylvia's significant colour and noting
      Plank's direct gaze as the waiter filled Leila's slender-stemmed glass.
      And &ldquo;nothing but Apollinaris,&rdquo; he said coolly, as the waiter approached
      him; but though his voice was easy enough, a dull patch of colour came out
      under the cheek-bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all I care for, either,&rdquo; said Sylvia with elaborate carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank and Leila immediately began to make conversation. Siward, his eyes
      bent on the glass of mineral water at his elbow, looked up in silence at
      Sylvia questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in her face he did not quite comprehend. She made as
      though to speak, looked at him, hesitated, her lovely face eloquent under
      the impulse. Then, leaning toward him, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And thy ways shall be my ways.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvia, you must not deny yourself, just because I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me. It is the happiest thing I have ever done for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but I do,&rdquo; she said, the low excited laughter scarcely fluttering her
      lips. &ldquo;Listen: I never before, in all my life, gave up anything for your
      sake, only this one little pitiful thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't let you!&rdquo; he breathed; &ldquo;it is nonsense to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must let me! Am I to be on friendly terms with&mdash;with your mortal
      enemy?&rdquo; She was still smiling, but now her sensitive mouth quivered
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat silent, considering her, his restless fingers playing with his
      glass in which the harmless bubbles were breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I drink to your health, Stephen,&rdquo; she said under her breath. &ldquo;I drink to
      your happiness, too; and&mdash;and to your fortune, and to all that you
      desire from fortune.&rdquo; And she raised her glass in the star-light, looking
      over it into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I desire from fortune?&rdquo; he repeated significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All&mdash;almost all&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, all,&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she only raised the glass to her lips, still looking at him as she
      drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      They became unreasonably gay almost immediately, though the beverage
      scarcely accounted for the delicate intoxication that seemed to creep into
      their veins. Yet it was sufficient for Siward to say an amusing thing
      wittily, for Sylvia to return his lead with all the delightful,
      unconscious brilliancy that he seemed to inspire in her&mdash;as though
      awaking into real life once more. All that had slumbered in her through
      the winter and spring, and the long, arid summer now crumbling to the edge
      of autumn, broke out into a delicate riot of exquisite florescence; the
      very sounds of her voice, every intonation, every accent, every pause,
      were charming surprises; her laughter was a miracle, her beauty a
      revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leila, aware of it, exchanged glance after glance with Plank. Siward,
      alternately the leader in it all, then the enchanted listener, bewitched,
      enthralled, felt care slipping from his shoulders like a mantle, and
      sadness exhaling from a heart that was beating strongly, steadily,
      fearlessly&mdash;as a heart should beat in the breast of him who has taken
      at last his fighting chance. He took it now, under her eyes, for honour,
      for manhood, and for the ideal which had made manhood no longer an empty
      term muttered in desperation by a sick body, and a mind too sick to
      control it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, at last the lifelong battle was on. He knew it. He knew, too,
      whatever his fate with her or without her, he must always go on with the
      battle for the safe-guarding of that manhood the consciousness of which
      she had aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      All he knew was that, through the medium of his love for her, whatever in
      him of the spiritual remained, or had been generated, was now awake,
      alive, strong, vital, indestructible&mdash;an impalpable current flowing
      from a sane intelligence, through medium of her, back to the eternal
      truth, returning always, always, to the deathless source from whence it
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lingering over the fruit, the champagne breaking in the glasses standing
      on the table between them, rim to rim, Leila and Plank had fallen into a
      low, desultory, yet guarded exchange of words and silences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia sprang up and pushed her chair into the farther corner against the
      balcony rail, where no light fell except the radiance of the stars. Here
      Siward joined her, dragging his chair around so that it faced her as she
      leaned back, tilted against a shadowy column.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this Bohemianism, Stephen? If it is, I rather like it. Don't you? You
      are going to smoke now, aren't you? Ah, that is delightful!&rdquo; daintily
      sniffing the aroma from his cigarette. &ldquo;It always reminds me of you&mdash;there
      on the cliffs, that first day. Do you remember?&mdash;the smoke from your
      cigarette whirling up in my face?... You say you remember. ...Oh, of
      course there's nothing else to say when a girl asks you... is there? Oh, I
      won't argue with you, if you insist that you do remember. You will not be
      like any other man if you do, that's all.... The little things that women
      remember!... And believe that men remember! It is pitiful in a way. There!
      I am not going to spill over, and I don't care a copper penny whether you
      really do remember or not!... Yes, I do care! ...Oh, all women care. It is
      their first disappointment to learn how much a man can forget and still
      remember to care for them&mdash;a little!... Stephen, I said a little; and
      that is all that you are permitted to care for me; isn't it?... Please,
      don't. You are deliberately beginning to say things!... Stephen, you
      silly! you are making love to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness his hand encountered hers on the wooden rail, and the
      tremor of the contact silenced her. She freed one finger, then let it rest
      with its slender fellow-prisoners. There was no use in trying to speak
      just then&mdash;utterly useless her voice in the soft, rounded throat
      imprisoned by the swelling pulses that tightened and hammered and
      tightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years seemed to fall away from her, slipping back, back into girlhood,
      into childhood, drawing not her alone on the gliding tide, but carrying
      him with her. An exquisite languor held her. Through it vague hints of
      those splendid visions of her lonely childhood rose, shaping themselves in
      the starry darkness&mdash;the old mystery of dreams, the old, innocent
      desires, the old simplicity of clairvoyance wherein right was right and
      wrong, wrong&mdash;in all the conventional significance of right and
      wrong, in all the old-fashioned, undisturbed faith of childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drifting deliciously, her eyes sometimes meeting his, sometimes lost in
      the magic of her reverie, she lay there in her chair, her unresisting
      fingers locked in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Odd little thoughts came hovering into her reverie&mdash;thoughts that
      seemed distantly familiar, the direct, unconscious impulses of a child. To
      feel was once more the only motive for expression; to think fearlessly was
      once more inherent; to desire was to demand&mdash;unlock her lips,
      naively, and ask for what she wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the spell, she turned her blue gaze on him, and her lips parted
      without a tremor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you offer for what you ask? And do you still ask it? Is it me you
      are asking me for? Because you love me? And what do you give&mdash;love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weigh it with the&mdash;other,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have&mdash;often&mdash;every moment since I have known you. And what a
      winter!&rdquo; Her voice was almost inaudible. &ldquo;What a winter&mdash;without
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That hell is ended for me, too. Sylvia, I know what I ask. And I ask. I
      know what I offer. Will you take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, blindly. She stood up, pale, wide-eyed, confronting him,
      stammering out the bargain:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take all&mdash;all! every virtue, every vice of you. I give all&mdash;all!
      all I have been, all I am, all I shall be! Is that enough? Oh, if there
      were only more to give! Stephen, if there were only more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hands had fallen into his, and they looked each other in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, through the hush of the enchanted moment, a sullen sound broke&mdash;the
      sound of a voice they knew, threateningly raised, louder and louder,
      growling, profanely menacing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aghast, they turned in the darkness, peering toward the lighted space
      beyond. Leroy Mortimer, his face shockingly congested, stood unsteadily
      balancing there, confronting his wife, who sat staring at him in horror.
      At the same instant Plank rose and laid a hand on Mortimer's shoulder, but
      Mortimer shook him off with a warning oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and I will settle with each other to-morrow!&rdquo; he said thickly,
      pointing a puffy finger at Plank. &ldquo;You'll find me at the Algonquin Trust.
      Do you hear? That's where you'll settle this matter&mdash;in the
      president's office!&rdquo; He stood swaying and leering at Plank, repeating
      loudly: &ldquo;In Quarrier's office! Understand? That's where you'll settle up!
      See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila, white face quivering, shrank as though he had struck her, and he
      turned on her again, grinning: &ldquo;As for you, you come home! And that'll be
      about all for yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you insane, to make a scene like this?&rdquo; whispered Plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mortimer swung on him insultingly: &ldquo;That's about all from you, too!&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;Leila, are you coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped heavily toward her; but Plank's sudden crushing grip was on his
      fat arm above the elbow, and he emitted a roar of surprise and pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't touch him! Don't, in Heaven's name!&rdquo; stammered Leila, as Plank,
      releasing him, stepped back beside her chair. &ldquo;Can't you see that I must
      go with him! I&mdash;I must go.&rdquo; She cast one terrified glance around her,
      where scores of strange faces met hers; and at every table people were
      standing up to see better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank, who had dropped Mortimer's arm as the latter emitted his bellow of
      amazement, stepped toward him again, dropping his voice as he spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go! Do you hear?&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I'll do what you ask me,
      to-morrow! I will do what you ask, if you'll go now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come&mdash;do you hear!&rdquo; snarled Mortimer, turning on his wife, who
      had already risen. &ldquo;If you don't I'll make a row here that you'll never
      hear the end of as long as you live! And there'll be nothing to talk over
      in Quarrier's office, if I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila looked at Plank, rose, and moved swiftly toward the veranda steps,
      her head resolutely lowered, the burning shame flaming in her face.
      Mortimer cast one triumphant glance at Plank, then waddled unsteadily
      after his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; he growled; &ldquo;I've a Mercedes here! I'll drive you back&mdash;wait!
      Here it is! Here we are!&rdquo; And to Quarrier's machinist he said: &ldquo;You get
      into the tonneau. I want to show Mrs. Mortimer what night-driving is. Do
      you hear? I tell you I'm going to drive this machine and show you how!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila scarcely heard him. She obeyed the impulse of his hand on her arm,
      and mounted to the seat, staring straight ahead of her with dazed and
      straining eyes that saw nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mortimer clambered to his seat, and, without an instant's warning,
      opened up and seized the wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unprepared, the machinist attempted to swing aboard, missed his footing in
      the uncertain light, and fell sprawling on the gravel. Plank saw him from
      the veranda and instantly vaulted the rail to the lawn below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You damn fool!&rdquo; yelled Mortimer, looking around, &ldquo;what in hell do you
      think you'll do?&rdquo; And he clapped on full speed as Plank made a leap for
      the car and missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mortimer laughed, and turned his head to look back, and the next instant
      something seemed to wrench the steering-wheel from its roots. There was a
      blinding glare of light, a scream, and the great machine bounded into the
      air full length, turned completely over, and lay across a flower-bed,
      partly on one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something was afire, too. Men were rushing from the verandas, women
      screamed, and stood up wringing their hands; a mounted policeman came
      galloping through the darkness; people shouted: &ldquo;Throw sand on it! Get
      shovels, for God's sake! Lift that tonneau! There's a woman under it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they were mistaken, for Leila lay at the foot of the slope, one little
      bloody hand clutching the dead grass; and Plank knelt beside her, giving
      his orders quietly to those who came running down the hill from the
      roadway above, which was now fiercely illuminated by burning gasoline. At
      last they got sand enough to quench the fire and men sufficient to lift
      the weight from the dead man's neck, and drag what was left of him onto
      the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't look,&rdquo; whispered Siward, drawing Sylvia back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and she both had put their shoulders to the tonneau along with the
      others; and now they stood there together in the shifting lantern-light,
      sickened, shivering under the summer stars, staring at the gathering crowd
      around that shapeless lump on the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank passed them, walking beside an improvised stretcher, calm, almost
      smiling, as Sylvia sprang forward with a little sob of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the doctor, over there; that man is a doctor; he knows,&rdquo; repeated
      Plank with studied deliberation, looking down at Leila's deathly face. &ldquo;He
      says it's all right; he says he'll get a candle, and that he can tell by
      the flame's effect on the pupils of the eyes what exactly is the matter.
      No,&rdquo; to Siward beside him, pressing forward through the crowd which eddied
      from the dead man to the stretcher; &ldquo;no, there is not a bone broken. She
      is stunned, that's all; she fell in the shrubbery. We'll have an ambulance
      here pretty quick. Stephen,&rdquo; using his first name unconsciously, &ldquo;won't
      you look out for Sylvia? I'm going back on the ambulance. If you'll find
      somebody to drive my machine, I wish you would take Sylvia back. No, I
      don't want you to drive, Stephen&mdash;if you don't mind. Get that
      machinist, please. I'm rattled, and I don't want you to drive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila lay on the stretcher, her bloodless face upturned to the stars.
      Beyond, under a blanket, something else lay very still on the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank beckoned a policeman, and whispered to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, far away in the darkness, a distant clamour grew on the night air,
      nearer, nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank, standing beside the stretcher, raised his head, listening to the
      ambulance arriving at full speed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV THE ENEMY LISTENS
    </h2>
    <p>
      In September, her marriage to Siward excitingly imminent, Sylvia had been
      seized with a passion for wholesale renunciation and rigid
      self-chastisement. All that had been so materially desirable to her in
      life, all that she had heretofore worshipped, in and belonging to her own
      world, she now denied. Down went the miniature golden calf from the altar
      in her private shrine, its tiny crashing fall making considerable racket
      throughout her world, and the planets and satellites adjacent to that
      section of the social system which she had long been expected to dominate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spectacle of their youthful ruler-elect in sackcloth as the future
      bride of a business man had more than disconcerted them. The amazing
      announcement of Quarrier's engagement to Agatha Caithness stupefied the
      elect, rendering in one harrowing instant null and void the thousand petty
      plans and plots, intrigues and schemes, upon which future social
      constructions on the social structure had been based.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grief and amazement of Major Belwether, already distracted by his
      non-participation, through his own fault, in Plank's consolidation of
      Amalgamated with Inter-County, was pitiable to the verge of the
      unpleasant. Like panic-stricken rabbits, his thoughts ran in circles, and
      he skipped in their wake, scurrying from Quarrier to Harrington, from
      Harrington to Plank, from Plank to Siward, in distracted hope of
      recovering his equilibrium and squatting safely somewhere in somebody's
      luxuriantly perpetual cabbage-patch. He even squeezed under the fence and
      hopped humbly about old Peter Caithness, who suddenly assumed monumental
      proportions among those who had so long tolerated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Quarrier coldly drove him away and the increasing crowds besieging
      poor, bewildered old Peter Caithness trod upon the major, and there was
      nothing for him to do but to scuttle back to his own brush-heap and huddle
      there, squeaking pitifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Grace Ferrall, she lost no time in tears, but took Agatha publicly
      to her bosom, turned furiously on Quarrier in private, and for the first
      time in her life permitted herself the luxury of telling him exactly what
      she thought of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had your chance,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but you are all surface! There's nothing
      to you but soft beard and manicuring, and the reticence of stupidity! The
      one girl for you&mdash;and you couldn't hold on to her! The one chance of
      your life&mdash;and it's escaped you, leaving a tuft of pompadour hair and
      a pair of woman's eyes protruding from the golden dust-heap your father
      buried you in. Now you'd better sit there and let it cover your mouth, and
      try to breathe through your nose. Agatha is looking for a new sensation;
      she's tried everything, now she's going to try you, that's all. She will
      be an invaluable leader, Howard, and we shall not yawn, I assure you. But,
      oh! the chance you've lost, for lack of a drop of red blood, and a barber
      to give you the beard of a man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Which merely deepened the fear and hatred which Quarrier had entertained
      for his pretty cousin from the depths of his silk-wadded cradle. As for
      Kemp Ferrall, now third vice-president of Inter-County, he only laughed
      with the tolerance of a man in safety; and, looking at Quarrier through
      the pickets of the financial fence, not only forgot how close his escape
      had been, but, being a busy and progressive young man, began to consider
      how he might ultimately extract a little profit from the expensive tenant
      of the enclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace made the journey to town to express herself freely for Sylvia's
      benefit; but when she saw Sylvia, the girl's radiant beauty checked her,
      and all she could say was: &ldquo;My dear! my dear, I knew you would do it! I
      knew you would fling him on his head. It's in your blood, you little jade!
      you little jilt! you mix of a baggage! I knew you'd behave like all the
      women of your race!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia held Mrs. Ferrall's pretty face impressed between both her hands,
      and looking her mischievously in the eyes, she whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Comme vous, maman, faut-il faire?&mdash;Eh! mes petits-enfants,
      pourquoi, Quand j'ai fait comme ma grand' mÃ¨re, Ne feriez-vous pas comme
      moi?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; said Mrs. Ferrall, &ldquo;I'll never meddle again&mdash;and the entire
      world may marry and take the consequences!&rdquo; Then she drove to the Santa
      Regina, where Marion was to join her in her return to Shotover; and she
      was already trying to make up her disturbed mind as to which might prove
      the more suitable for Marion&mdash;Captain Voucher, gloomily recovering
      from his defeat by Quarrier, or Billy Fleetwood, who didn't want to marry
      anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, Siward's new duties as second vice-president of
      Inter-County had given him scant leisure for open-air convalescence. He
      was busy with Plank; he was also busy with the private investigation
      stirred up at the Patroons' Club and the Lenox, and which was slowly but
      inevitably resulting in clearing him, so that his restoration to good
      standing and full membership remained now only a matter of formal
      procedure.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Siward was becoming a very busy man among men; and Plank, still
      carrying on his broad shoulders burdens unbearable by any man save such a
      man as he, shook his heavy head, and ordered Siward into the open. And
      Siward, who had learned to obey, obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But September had nearly ended, when Leila, in Plank's private car,
      attended by Siward and Sylvia and two trained nurses, arrived at the
      Fells. The nurses&mdash;Plank's idea&mdash;were a surprise to Leila; and
      the day after her arrival at the Fells she dismissed them, got out of bed,
      and dressed and came downstairs all alone, on a pair of sound though
      faltering legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia and Siward were in the music-room, very busily figuring out the
      probable cost of a house in that section of the city east of Park Avenue,
      where the newly married imprudent are forming colonies&mdash;a just
      punishment for those reckless brides who marry for love, and are obliged
      to drive over two car-tracks to reach their wealthy friends and relatives
      of the Golden Zone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Leila, in her pretty invalid's gown of lace, stood silently at the
      music-room door, watching them. Her thick, dark hair was braided, and
      looped up under a black bow behind; and she looked like a curious and
      impertinent schoolgirl peeping at them there through the crack of the
      door, bending forward, her joined hands flattened between her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said at length, in a frankly disappointed voice, &ldquo;is that all
      you do when your chaperone is abed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angel!&rdquo; cried Sylvia, springing up, &ldquo;how in the world did you ever manage
      to come downstairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the usual number of feet. If you think it's very gay up there&mdash;&rdquo;
       She laid her hands in Sylvia's, and looked at Siward with all the old
      mockery in her eyes&mdash;eyes which slanted a little at the corners,
      Japanese-wise: &ldquo;Stephen, you are growing positively plump. You'd better
      not do that until Sylvia marries you. Look at him, dear! He's getting all
      smooth in the cheeks, like a horrid undergraduate boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She released one hand and greeted Siward. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said serenely,
      replying to his inquiry, &ldquo;I am perfectly well. You pay me no compliment
      when you ask me, after you have seen me.&rdquo; And to Sylvia, looking at her
      white flannels: &ldquo;What have you been playing? What do you find to do with
      yourself, Sylvia, with that plump sun-burned boy at your heels all day
      long? Are there no men about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One's coming to-day,&rdquo; said Sylvia, laughing; and slipping her arm around
      Leila's waist, she strolled with her out through the tall glass doors to
      the terrace, with a backward glance of airy dismissal for Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plank had wired from New York, the night before, that he was coming; in
      another hour he would be there. Leila knew it perfectly well, and she
      looked into the wickedly expressive young face of the girl beside her,
      eyes soft but unsmiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child, child,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;you do not know how much of a man a man can
      be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do!&rdquo; said Sylvia hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leila smiled. &ldquo;Hush, you little silly! I've talked Stephen and praised
      Stephen to you for days and days, and the moment I dare mention another
      man you fly at me, hair on end!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Leila, I know it! I'm perfectly mad about him, that's all. But don't
      you think he is looking like himself again? And, Leila, isn't he strangely
      attractive?&mdash;I don't mean just because I happen to be in love with
      him, but give me a perfectly cold and unbiassed opinion, dear, because
      there is simply no use in a girl's blinding herself to facts, or in
      ignoring certain fixed laws of symmetry, which it is perfectly obvious
      that Mr. Siward fulfils in those well-known and established proportions
      which&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asked, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. Only for two solid weeks&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if you are not interested&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am, child&mdash;I am! desperately interested! He is handsome! I
      knew him before you did, and I thought so then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; said Sylvia, troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did. When I wore short skirts I kissed him, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you? W&mdash;what did he wear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knickerbockers, silly! You don't think he was still in the cradle, do
      you? I'm not as aged as that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I missed a great deal in my childhood,&rdquo; said Sylvia naÃ¯vely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By not knowing Stephen? Pooh! He used to pinch me, and then we'd put out
      our tongues in mutual derision. Once&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said Sylvia faintly. &ldquo;And anyhow, you probably taught him.... Look
      at him as he saunters across the lawn, Leila&mdash;look at him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? I see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't he almost an ideal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is. He certainly is, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he walks as though he were perfectly well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know,&rdquo; said Leila thoughtfully. &ldquo;Sometimes people whose
      walk is a gracefully languid saunter develop adipose tissue after forty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Really, Leila, do you think he walks like a perfectly well
      man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may be coming down with whooping-cough&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia rose indignantly, but Leila pulled her back to the sun-warmed
      marble bench:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A girl in love loses her sense of humour temporarily. Sit down, you
      little vixen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leila, you laugh at everything when I don't feel like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not in love, and that's why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leila looked at her, then under her breath: &ldquo;In love, am I&mdash;with the
      whole young world ringing with the laughter I had forgotten the very sound
      of? Do you call that love?&mdash;with the sea and sky laughing back at me,
      and the wind in my ears fairly tremulous with laughter? Do you, who look
      out upon the pretty world so seriously through those sea-blue eyes of
      yours, think that I can be in love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Leila, a girl's happiness is serious enough, isn't it? Dear, it
      frightens me! I was so close to losing it&mdash;once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lost mine,&rdquo; said Leila, closing her eyes for a moment. &ldquo;I shall not
      sigh if I find it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat there in the sun, Leila's hand lying idly in Sylvia's, the soft
      sea-wind stirring their hair, and in their ears the thunderous undertone
      of the mounting sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at Stephen!&rdquo; murmured Sylvia, her enraptured eyes following him as
      he strolled hatless and coatless along the cliff's edge, the sun
      glimmering on his short hair, a tall, slim, well-coupled, strongly knit
      shape against the sky and sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Leila's quick ear had caught a significant sound from the gravel drive
      behind her, and she stood up, a delicious colour tinting her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going in?&rdquo; asked Sylvia. Then she, too, heard the subdued
      whirring of a motor from the front of the house, and she looked at Leila
      as she turned and recrossed the terrace, walking slowly but erect, her
      pretty head held high.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Sylvia faced the sea again and presently descended the terrace,
      crossing the long lawn toward the headland, where Siward stood looking out
      across the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leila, from the music-room, watched her; then she heard Plank's voice, and
      his step on the stair, and she called out to him gaily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am downstairs, thank you. How dared you send me those foolish nurses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was laughing when he came into the room, standing there erect, head
      high, a brilliant colour in her cheeks; and she offered him both hands
      which he took between his own, holding them strongly, and looking into her
      face with steady, questioning eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said, still smiling, but her scarlet under-lip trembled a
      little; then: &ldquo;Yes, you may say what you wish&mdash;what I&mdash;I wish
      you to say.... There can be no harm in talking about it. But&mdash;will
      you be very gentle with me? Don't m-make me cry; I h-have&mdash;I am
      t-trying to remember how it feels to laugh once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia, lying in the hot sand on the tiny crescent beach under the cliffs,
      listened gravely to Siward's figures, as, note-book in hand, he went over
      the real-estate problem, commenting thoughtfully as he discussed the
      houses offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty by a hundred and two; good rear, north side of the street&mdash;next
      door to the Tommy Barclays, you know, Sylvia; only they're asking
      forty-two-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is an outrage!&rdquo; said Sylvia seriously; &ldquo;besides, I remember there
      was a wretched cellar, and only a butler's pantry extension. I'd much
      rather have that little house in Sixty-fourth Street, where the
      Fetherbraynes live&mdash;next house on the west, you know. Then we can
      pull it down and build&mdash;when we want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won't be able to afford to build for a while, you know,&rdquo; said Siward
      doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do we care, dear? We'll have millions of things to do, anyway, and
      what is the use of building?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As many things to do as that?&rdquo; he said, looking over his note-book with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More! Are we not just beginning to live, and open our eyes, silly?
      Listen: Books, books, books, from top to bottom of the house, that is what
      I want first of all&mdash;except my piano.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do let us have a little plumbing, dear,&rdquo; he said so seriously that for a
      fraction of a second she was on the verge of taking him seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why extravagant plumbing when books furnish sufficient circulation for
      the flow of soul, dear?&rdquo; she retorted gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody we know will ever come to see us, if they think we read books,&rdquo;
       said Siward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it delightful!&rdquo; sighed Sylvia. &ldquo;We're going to become frumps! I
      mustn't forget the blue stockings for my trousseau, and you mustn't forget
      the California claret for the cellar, dear. We will need it when we read
      Henry James to each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Siward, resting his weight on one hand, laughed, and looked out at the
      surf drenching the reefs with silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I could ever have been enough afraid of the sea
      to hate it! After all, at low tide the reef is always there in the same
      place and none the worse for the drenching. All that surf only shows how
      strong a rock can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, and turned to look at Sylvia; and she lay there, silent, blue
      eyes looking back into his. Suddenly they glimmered with tears, and she
      stretched out both arms, drawing his head down to hers convulsively, her
      quivering mouth crushed against his lips. Then she rose to her knees, to
      her feet, dazed, brushing the tears from her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think&mdash;to think,&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;that I might have let you face
      the world alone! Dearest, dearest, we must fight a good fight. The sea is
      always there&mdash;always, always there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked straight into her eyes, fearlessly, tenderly, and she looked
      back with the divine, untroubled gaze of a child, laying her slender,
      sun-tanned hands in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, deep in his body, as he stood there, he heard the low challenge of
      his soul on guard; and he knew that the Enemy listened.
    </p>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
